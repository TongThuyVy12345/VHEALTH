Adaptation is the willingness to learn, to make mistakes, and to learn more. Adaptability is the ability to gather the amount of feedback needed to adjust or change a person's behavior to produce positive and effective results. Most of us approach new situations with a system of prejudices, including what we think is possible. This prejudice can be rooted in personal experience, the experience of others, or simply from false beliefs. We then form rules about what happens based on these beliefs, and those laws often influence our choices and actions. Whether it's changing our diet, starting a relationship or taking on a new job, we approach each situation with a set of expectations, demands, and wants. Expectation: what we think will happen Demand: what we really need to happen Desire: what we want to happen The power to adapt to any situation in life lies in understanding expectations, requirements and expectations. ask and what our desires really are.

For example, you entered an unhappy love/marriage, that love hurt you, caused you a lot of pain. Let's say, you give up and decide to end the relationship. Then, you have a fresher, much happier life, learn to love and take care of yourself more, then that is a worthy choice. However, in the same story, assuming you are determined not to give up, you patiently change yourself and make an effort to change your family. In the end, your love changes for the better. You change – your loved ones change, so your choice is also a worthy choice. To conclude something, each of us should continue to make efforts or should stop at the right time to have a multi-dimensional view of the problem. Only when we have a multi-dimensional view, combined with thorough analytical thinking, inference and synthesis of information can we hope to come to an informed conclusion. Life has a paradox that sometimes we have to be the decision makers. But decisions are not a choice between good and bad, but sometimes a choice between bad and less bad. Then have to analyze which one is less harmful to choose that one. Therefore, giving up or fighting hard is a gray area that is not easy to make decisions and choices.

5.0, how does social learning theory work?,social learn theori work,"During the first half of the twentieth century, behavioral psychology became the dominant school. Behavioral psychologists argue that learning is the result of direct experience with the environment through processes of association and reinforcement. Bandura's theory, although rooted in many fundamental concepts from traditional learning theory, believes that direct reinforcement cannot be effective for all forms of learning. For example, children and adults often learn many things that they have no direct experience with. Even if you've never used a baseball bat in your life, you probably know what to do if someone hands you a baseball bat and tells you to try it. This is because you have seen other people perform this action in person or on television. While behavioral theories of learning argue that all forms of learning are the result of associations formed from the past. processes of conditioning, reinforcement, and punishment, Bandura's social learning theory argues that learning can also occur simply by observing the actions of others. His theory adds a social element, arguing that people can learn new information and behaviors by observing others. Called Observational Learning, this form of learning can be used to explain a wide range of behaviors, including those that cannot be explained by other learning theories.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5.0,social learning theory?,social learn theori,"There are three core concepts at the heart of social learning theory. The first is the idea that humans can learn through observation. Then there is the view that the inner mental state is an integral part of this process. Ultimately, the theory posits that learning something does not mean a change in behavior will occur. Bandura explained in his 1977 Theory of Social Learning that “Learning would be extremely difficult, if not dangerous, if people relied solely on behavioral effects.” to decide what to do next. Fortunately, most human behavior is learned intuitively through patterns: from observing others, we form ideas about how behavior is formed, and in the time associated with behavior. that vi. This encrypted information then acts as a guide to action.” Let's delve deeper into these concepts: Humans can learn through observation. Mental state plays an important role in the learning process.

5.0,how does observational learning happen?,observ learn happen,"It should be noted that not all observable behaviors are successfully learned. Why? Factors related to both the learning model and the target audience also play a role in determining whether the social learning process takes place successfully. Certain requirements and procedures also need to be followed. The following processes are involved in model building and observational learning: * Note: To learn, you need to focus on it. Anything that distracts you will have a negative effect on observational learning. If the learning model is interesting or the situation is new, chances are high that you will focus more on learning. Memory capacity: The ability to store information is also an important component of the learning process. Memory capacity can be affected by a number of factors, but the ability to retrieve information later and process information based on that information is critical to observational learning. Simulate behavior: Once you've focused on modeling and storing information, it's time to actually implement the behavior you've observed. The more you practice the learned behaviors, the more skills you will improve and strengthen. * Motivation: Finally, for observational learning to be successful, you must be motivated to imitate the modeled behavior. Reinforcement and punishment play an important role in motivation. While it is very effective to experience these motivating factors directly, it is equally effective to observe others experiencing them. For example, if you see a student being rewarded for being early to class, you might arrive a few minutes early each day.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Forever ""forgetting"" past mistakes does not help you live happily and happily! How to forgive the mistakes of others is both a beautiful life value and a life skill that helps you to be happy in the present.

The question here is that introverts are associated with silence, so do they like listening to music? The answer is yes. They love and really enjoy listening to music. But the noise of music is encapsulated through a small headset. They often read books and listen to music at the same time.

They will want to explore the outside world rather than stay indoors. So let's give nature-inspired art lamps! Introverts really love the little things. So give them a small pot of plants like succulents, or a few pots containing ready-made seeds like carnations, ten o'clock flowers, etc., they will be delighted to watch the growth of that plant daily. At the same time, they are also meticulous people so don't worry, those pots will be taken care of very carefully. Give an introvert a pretty and simple water bottle. Because they are always concerned about their own health, they often make their own dishes that are both delicious and hygienic. If you give them a bottle of water, they can make the water and return it as a thank you! Print a photo of that introverted friend on a color changing mug. When you give them that cup, when you pour boiling water into the cup, their image will appear on the side of the cup, which will make them really touched and surprised. Because they realize that they really have friends, and around them there are still many people who love and support them wholeheartedly. Essential oils are also a really good gift for introverts. You can give them a set of small bottles of essential oils that they can both use and collect. Give them essential oils that smell like lavender. The scent of lavender is very effective in reducing stress, fatigue, stress, headaches and migraines. This is suggested based on the personality as well as the characteristics of the introvert.

2.0,how should i respond to a compliment?,respond compliment,"When you're getting to know someone and offer a compliment, how do you expect to react? Most expect a thank you. What do you think when the response to a compliment (about how great they look or how smart they are) is 'I know'. Are face-to-face and online responses perceived differently? It could be otherwise, and this study will show why the answer is so important. Maria DelGreco and Amanda Denes in an article titled 'You're not as cute as you think' looked at how it feels to give and receive compliments. They note that initiating heterosexual relationships is associated with interpretation of sexual communication cues. They note that making friends online is sensitive and can have negative consequences. One of the ways to get to know each other is to use compliments. DelGreco and Denes have defined 'praise as an action verb that explicitly or implicitly acknowledges the good qualities of another, not the speaker, and often the listener, which both the speaker and the listener share. care about. positive reviews'. They recognize the value of compliments in developing relationships, and in the online context, sincere compliments are most effective. They note that women are often praised for their looks and men are often praised for what they possess. Regarding the 'right' response to a compliment, DelGreco and Denes note that English speakers expect a 'thank you'. Regarding gender-based differences, they noted that more women answered yes than men. Research shows that while compliments are often used to flirt with each other, gender and cultural differences can lead to misunderstandings, misunderstandings, and conflicts. DelGreco and Denes used expectations violation theory to explore women's perceived responses to compliments in the context of online dating communication. Using 413 samples of college students in the United States, they found that female samples who violated negative expectations by responding to compliments with approval and self-praise were perceived more negatively than female samples. violate expectations. Be positive by disagreeing with the compliment or the model confirms the expectation by simply replying 'thank you'. These findings illustrate the impact of expectations violation theory in the context of online dating. To explain the study results, they note that 'evaluating the positive female offending sample is different from the female sample confirming expectations for all outcome variables, the positive female offending sample being underestimated in terms of health side. Social attractiveness, conversational ability, likability, power and self-esteem relative to female models confirm the expectations'. They also note that the female sample of negative violators was rated as 'low in social attractiveness, suitability and conversational ability, but had higher power and self-esteem than female models confirm expectations' . They note that this finding is consistent with older research on expectation violation theory, which found that 'negative expectation violation leads to worse-than-expected interaction outcomes'. They also note that fictitious messages on online dating sites are initial communication between parties in an environment without interpersonal signals. They also note that in the context of a lack of other interpersonal signals, women's negative abuse patterns such as overconfidence are less successful in online dating and even more vulnerable to harassment. more online. Clearly the power of a simple 'thank you' seems to be the most effective response in the early stages of a romantic prospect. These two simple words are expected, accepted, and even expressed lovable modesty that has psychological appeal and is appreciated no matter how attractive the person is physically.

1.0,signs of an extroverted child,sign extrovert child,"Some children appear shy around crowds of strangers, such as friends at the playground or the first day of school. However, extroverted children can quickly adapt to new environments, making new acquaintances for the first time. Children love to explore, take on challenges or create new games. Extroverted children love to interact with people around them in many ways, but the most common is by talking. They like to communicate, they don't even feel tired or lack of topics, even though they talk a lot. When interacting with people around them, they like to be around people like themselves. Unlike introverted children who think in silence, extroverts think while they speak. They can improve behavior, better awareness when they can speak out the problems in their hearts. Therefore, when raising extroverted children, parents should spend a lot of time listening and talking to their children. In contrast to introverts who prefer to take on tasks on their own, extroverts work best in groups. For example, at school, they like to join clubs, teams or do group assignments and get better results when they work alone. Many extroverted children also volunteer to be group leaders to lead or persuade people to do what they want. The ability to connect with others is a trait of extroverted children, so it's normal for them to take on leadership roles. They also love to influence or inspire people. Not only regularly participating in group activities, extroverted children also like social activities, where there are large gatherings of people and group games. After the activity is over, the children may feel sad or nostalgic because they were so absorbed in the activities. In addition, they will hang out with friends more than spend time at home alone. Being around others is like positive energy for extroverts. Parents can use this feature when they want to negotiate with their child. For example, you could say, ""I'll help you with the housework, I'll let you come over to my house to play"" and your extroverted child will agree. Extroverts are not afraid to express themselves and their individuality. They can stand up to share their opinions and views, even fight to the end to protect them. In addition, children who are extroverted are often open to people around them, show good emotions, and are very sociable. Many people think that extroverts are aggressive, prone to anger or violent behavior, but this is the wrong view. Despite their confident, bubbly personalities, extroverted kids don't turn positive energy into violent behavior. They use energy to blend in with their surroundings and communicate with people. Extroverted children often bring upbeat, positive energy and connect people around. They are also good at inventing games or leading people to work in teams. So friends often like to surround the extroverted child. If your child is an extrovert, it wouldn't be surprising if your home is often crowded with noisy kids or if your child has a lot of playmates. In addition, extroverted children are stimulated by those around them. When they are alone, they will feel bored and bored. When they are with friends, they will come up with many creative ideas and perform many tasks efficiently. Because of their bubbly nature, many people consider extroverts to be stubborn, naughty, and out of control. In fact, children who lose control do not like to be helped, do not think about the responsibility of the problem, whereas extroverted children like to mingle with people and have a high ability to take responsibility. Extroverted kids will sometimes interrupt others, but parents can teach their kids about patience. They will listen and change because extroverts always want to be better and leave a mark in the eyes of others. Extroverted kids aren't good at suppressing their emotions, and hiding them makes them uncomfortable. Instead, children tend to express anger, sadness to happiness.

2.0,the influence of applied psychology in marketing,influenc appli psycholog market,"In marketing, understanding the psychology and needs of customers is extremely necessary. Understanding customers will help products and prices become friendly and close to customers to influence purchasing decisions. Master the fundamentals of psychology to enhance the effectiveness of your marketing campaigns. Helping you attract, convince more customers and support your marketing campaigns more effectively. I share with you 9 Applied Psychological Effects in Marketing below. Add an additional price as bait You'll often see this effect in product pricing models that try to convince you to choose the most expensive product while you're content to think you've made a lot of money. In Dan Ariely's famous TED talk, ""Are we in control of our decisions?"", he describes a The Economist ad featuring the latest subscriptions. Here's what they offer: You can easily get combo packs for just the price of printed packages. Why are they offering that price? Is there any mistake here? That's what Airley thought too. He contacted the sales people at that store, but they always refused to answer him and insisted they were not mistaken. So he decided to do this “puzzling” study with 100 MIT students. He gave them the above service packages and asked them which package they wanted to buy. As a result, students chose to sign up for a combo package. But when unchecking the “print package for $125,” this student chose the cheapest online plan at $59. Turns out the second plan isn't useless at all – it highlights the ""greatness"" of the combo and entices buyers to pay extra for that option. When you want to sell a product or service, create another product (bait) that is priced close to the product you want to sell but the value the customer receives is normal when buying another product. Then the product you want to sell will be more prominent, attracting more attention to customers. Give First, Get More Introduced in Dr. Robert Cialdini's book, Impact: Explaining the Psychology of Persuasion, the concept of reciprocity is easy to understand – if someone does something for you. , you will naturally want to do something for them. If you've ever received money with a bill at a restaurant, you've been a victim of reciprocity. According to Cialdini, when a waiter brings a bill to a customer without mints, diners tip based on what they think of the restaurant's service. When mint was added, the average tip increased by 3.3%. Two mints? Tipping can be increased up to 20%. In your marketing, there are many ways to take advantage of the principle of reciprocity. You can give anything from a sweater, an exclusive e-book, to a free computer background or your expertise on a difficult topic. Even something as simple as a handwritten note can have a lasting effect. You just need to make sure you're giving something away for free before asking for something in return. Business or marketing is all about giving first. So is this life. When the value of our giving is large enough, the value in return will not let us down. Create viral content to get people talking about it. The contagion effect is a theory that people will adopt the beliefs or actions of a group of people they like or trust. In other words, it's the ""me too"" effect. Think of this like when you are in class and when the teacher calls to answer a question, most students feel embarrassed to stand up in front of the class. If you raise your hand to speak, everyone will feel happier and the class will start to get a little more lively when they join in to speak. (Remember, this still holds true as you get older and actively engage with your teacher's questions.) An easy way to optimize viral effects is to create viral content that many people enjoy. and information sharing. Gradually, the effect will spread to more people. To make customers think they need to buy as soon as possible. I went to buy a plane ticket and saw the slogan “Only 3 seats left at this price!” Yes, that is scarcity (scarcity – another concept of Cialdini). This psychological principle follows a basic supply and demand formula: The rarer an opportunity, asset, or product, the higher its value. In 1975, Worchel, Lee and Adewole conducted a study to see how scarcity affects people's perceptions. At the beginning of the study, they asked people to rate a chocolate chip cookie. According to a paper by colleague Lanya Olmstead describing the experiment, “Researchers put ten cookies in one jar and two cookies in another. Biscuits from a jar of two are worth twice as much as cookies from a jar of ten even though all cookies are identical.” But if you want to use this principle correctly, you need to be careful when choosing the right words to describe it. If you use the term khan in your marketing for your products or services, then even though you still have many products, due to popular demand and appropriate word usage, people will be very easily influenced. Therefore, you often see ads with calls to action such as: “only today”, “only 1 hour left”, “only 10 products left”,… Customers do not want to lose what they are doing. Have. get it from you for free Loss phobia happens when you have something, you really, really want to lose it. When Daniel Kahneman researched this concept, participants were given cups, chocolates, or nothing at all. They were then asked to give one of two choices: If given an item, they could exchange it, or if nothing, they could choose one of two items. Result? Nearly half of the participants who started with no items received a cup, but 86% of those who received a cup from scratch didn't change anything. In other words, people don't want to lose what they already have. The phobia of loss is important in freemium products. For example, you can get a feature for the free version of a product for a certain period of time. After that period, the feature will be removed unless you upgrade the product by paying extra. While you certainly have to be careful when using this psychological need, loss phobia is a very important concept every marketer needs to know. Prices go up and down like the sale Have you ever wondered why it's so hard to stop being attracted to the sale season at your favorite clothing store? Usually, it is related to the anchor effect – people make decisions based on the first information they receive. So if my favorite store used to sell jeans for $50 and now they're on sale for $35, I'd be happy. “I have a surprise promotion,” I thought. Maybe I can even buy them. But if my friend usually buys jeans for $20, she won't find the promotion as impressive. For marketers, anchors are important — especially if you're discounting. You'll want to state the initial price of the product (this is the ""setup"" of the anchors), then display the reduced price right next to it. You can even explain with that discount, how much profit the customer will get. This helps customers have a more favorable view of the price of the product. Like with the Big Holiday Sale, it's easy to say ""raise then lower"" to make customers think they've got a bargain. This can be successfully applied to less popular products (less people know about their value) and branded sellers in the market. Repeated appearances for customers to remember Have you ever heard of a product and then started seeing it everywhere? This is the Baader-Meinhof phenomenon. It starts happening after you encounter something for the first time, and then you start to notice it in your daily life. Suddenly, you see ads for the product every time you watch TV and every time you go grocery shopping. And ALL of your friends use it. It's great isn't it? According to PS Mag, this phenomenon (also known as the “frequency illusion”) is caused by two processes. “First, there is selective attention when you take in a new word, thing, or idea, then you pay attention to it unconsciously and often find it by surprise as a result. This makes you feel like new words, things or ideas are everywhere overnight. For marketers, this phenomenon is exactly why repetition is so important. Once someone starts to notice your brand (or regularly visits your website), you'll want to help them see you ""everywhere"". This effect is similar to the TV commercials we often see. An advertisement repeated several times a day, my consciousness will passively absorb. At some point this brand or product will be imprinted in your mind and will feel familiar with it. According to a study by Poppenk, Joanisse, Danckert and Köhler, people remember the essence of what others say, not the specifics. They call this the “primary psychological effect”. According to data from Chartbeat, more than half of your visitors will spend less than 15 seconds on your website. So, if people don't read your content and don't remember the specifics, what's the marketer to do? I recommend spending more time perfecting the title of the article. Not only should it be easy to find and share, but it should also accurately describe the content of your article. This way, when people are looking for more information on a certain topic, they will think of a useful article they have read and use Google to find it again. If you successfully complete your task, you will appear in the search results. Grouping products to make it easier for customers to remember People have a limited amount of space in their short-term memory. In fact, most people can only remember seven different pieces of information at a time. To solve this problem, we should group similar information together. For example, if you have a whole list of random items, most people will tend to group products into certain groups (dairy, grains, meat, etc.) more exactly. book. So when you create content, keep the team in mind. One way to design and layout content that's easier for readers to remember is to group similar topics together – by numbering or sizing headings differently. Your text will become much easier to read and remember.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2.0,which human emotion is the most negative?,human emot neg,"In a state of shame, people tend to want to run away, want to become ""invisible"", consciousness is paralyzed.

Thereby it can be seen that the most negative human emotion is shame. Research by Dr. R.Hawkins shows that each person has a different vibrational frequency or energy level depending on their spirit, ranging from 1 to 1,000. For example, if a person feels ashamed or humiliated, their mental energy level is the lowest, only 20. Meanwhile, guilt is also the most negative emotion. emotional level of Dr. David R. Hawkins.

See also: 10 ways to control anger when in love - The secret to eternal love Also according to the analysis of Dr. David R. Hawkins, the indifference, coldness of people can also create huge negative emotions for a person, making their energy very low (50). Indifference here also means indifference to oneself – i.e. lack of enthusiasm for all aspects of life. Besides the energy chart of negative emotions, the energy chart of positive emotions shows that positive emotions such as pride, love, courage, joy... all bring high energy. According to analysis, courage brings human energy to 200. Courage is the foundation of self-development and decisive decision-making. At lower energies, the world is very scary. Thanks to the energy of courage, life seems safer, fresher and more enjoyable. Thanks to that, people have the ability to seize opportunities in life. Obstacles can ""swallow"" people with energy levels below 200. In his research, Dr. David R. Hawkins points out that the highest energy level humans reach is 700+, with clarity. . . This level of energy is related to self-awareness. Only about one in ten million people reach this “realm”. When this energy level is reached, people feel ""time and space are floating, nothing is fixed, everything is alive and radiant"". Although the world is still the same in the eyes of others, for them, the world is a constantly dancing stream of evolution, in harmony with the evolution of nature and man. Emotion level charts play an important role, helping people to become aware of their energy levels and regulate it. Although happiness, sadness, anger, love... are emotional states that everyone will experience, but if we keep ourselves in a bad mental state for a long time, the harm to the human body is not. may not be mentioned.

However, the most important thing is that “When will the payment be made” is not mentioned at all. When they come to borrow money, they will show an extremely sincere and earnest attitude, relying on all kinds of brothers and friends so far, using very painful reasons to convince us to ""help"" them. in difficult times. But when they have the money in hand, they can quickly turn around, without going back and forth or communicating with creditors. The payment due date also uses one reason after another to delay, the contract requires an extension, even a willingness to block phone numbers or other methods of communication between the two parties. This is the most obnoxious type of person because chances are, they didn't intend to pay you in the first place. If you ask for a debt many times, they will casually reprimand you like this: “Don't you find it difficult for me? Your family is rich, stable and not short of money, but you still want to ask for money from me? Do you still consider me your brother? Have you thought about friendships over the past few years? What a scum!” See, the money I gave was not only not thanked, but also blamed for the darkness, like using money to buy revenge.

Their money does not fall from the sky, so they cannot ""excessively spread their hands"" to send to those who do not deserve it, because of things that do not deserve it.

We all know that life is sometimes rich and poor, no one can predict what will happen. So there is no shortage of times when we have to borrow money from others to get through a temporary difficult period. The feeling that the borrower opens his mouth is also uncomfortable, but in order to maintain a good relationship between the borrower and the lender, we must proactively identify several points: First, the relationship between the borrower and the lender.

2.0,what do you know about introverts?,know introvert,"Introverts are often defined as shy, self-deprecating, and losers. But according to research, the success rate of introverts is higher than extroverts. People often assume that introverts tend to be content with having few friends and often don't prioritize social activities, even when they're shy and losers. But you are wrong, Einstein, Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, Chow Sing Chi... are all introverts. According to survey data, among successful people, the number of people with an introvert personality is much higher than that of an extrovert. Successful people often have a talent for speaking, they can stand in front of a crowd and speak fluently, non-stop. In the eyes of most people, extroverts seem to succeed more easily than introverts. There is a very good saying about human psychology, don't judge a book by its cover (""Don't examine a book by its cover""). Whether introverted or extroverted, each group has its own advantages and differences, but unfortunately many people still judge a fish by the way it climbs a tree (as Einstein said) so they always attribute those who don't. climb tree. Introversion is passive, inactive, sluggish. Everyone's temperament is innate, almost impossible to change, but character can be cultivated. Introverts don't talk much, but when they don't, they're thinking. Respect these differences instead of judging them by your standards. You will learn how to adapt to an introvert's single life. In fact, living alone is not synonymous with loneliness, but on the contrary, this lifestyle also helps to cultivate our feelings, interests and inner self. In addition, introverts are also very self-taught. They are usually readers, philosophers or people working in the medical field. Another advantage of introverts is that they are often able to focus on details, even when the people around them often overlook. Studies show that in introverts, the brain is more active when processing visual information. Introverts don't talk much, they don't like to talk quietly, but they know how to listen and have the most sympathetic heart. When you're sad, extroverts, after listening to you, will lead you to bustling places. Introverts can not only listen to your sadness, but can also help you through it. When you are in trouble, the most important thing is someone who understands you. Having such a friend is truly the happiest thing in the world. See also: 9 illusions we use to deceive ourselves Introverts are always good listeners. They may not be easy to approach but they are always willing to listen to your every story. And that is also the reason why the leadership ability of introverts is higher than that of extroverts, especially when subordinates actively confide in them. An extroverted leader sometimes won't keep up with his employees' thoughts, but an introverted leader won't. They will listen to and process employee information. This advantage in them is especially effective in helping them become more confident in one-on-one communication situations. Introverts are mostly good at prioritizing their work, their daily schedule, or their survivors. in his life. Since they take the time to prioritize, they tend not to miss any tasks. As practical people, introverts are not good at dealing with too many things at once. They are pretty clear about what they can handle and what they can't (human included). As a result, they tend to prioritize work, schedules, communication with people, and social interaction to ensure that it yields positive results. Introverts are the most trustworthy, because they can keep secrets. Everyone knows that they will not arbitrarily discuss others behind their backs, nor spread the news everywhere.

Confessions of a 28-year-old girl…. I can't remember the last time I really relaxed. Really, now I don't even know how to relax. Every time I was about to read a book or watch TV, I worried that I was wasting time that I could have spent doing other things - that to-do list immediately popped into my head. And I feel guilty because I know I have tons of things to do: clean the house, go to the gym, or buy a birthday present for my boyfriend's mother. Just like that, my brain never stops working.

The idea of this burnout syndrome was first mentioned by Anna Helen Petersen, an editor at BuzzFeed. Her article pointed out that today the line between work and daily life is so blurred, sometimes indistinguishable that we lose our balance. Moreover, now everyone is online 24/7 and is always ""contactable"", whether for work, social media or love affairs. Of course, even while traveling. The article influenced many people and received mixed opinions, prompting the author to later write another article to express those mixed opinions.

I know life wasn't easy in my parents' day, and we're much happier than they were, but we still have the troubles of our generation. If the previous generation understood the pressures young people are facing today, they would be less likely to think that today's youth are lazy and take things too seriously.

From a serious person who trusts his wife, but after the shock of being ""cuckold"" by his wife, many husbands have changed their lifestyles, dated all kinds of people and then recorded those depraved images to ""torture"". ""The pain of adultery"", Venerable Thich Nhat Tu said, adultery is inherently a long, diverse and complex story, especially in today's society, adulterous men and women are harmful consequences for the family. According to Buddhism, an adulterer husband or wife is considered a ""murderer"" that kills family happiness. Having an adulterous wife is often more terrible than a woman's.

Some people cheat because their husbands are incompetent. There are also women who cheat because of sexual needs, but this number is not many. Women cheat largely because of lack of love or lack of economic life. According to Most Venerable Thich Nhat Tu, when his wife has an affair, the husband should not hold grudges. Instead of letting their son's mentality when betrayed is resentful, husbands should find ways to analyze the causes and overcome them. After all, the wife is still determined to leave to follow the call of her new love, so don't regret it anymore. Think simply, ""I'm lucky to have someone to carry it for me"". Thinking like this, husbands will no longer think of themselves as abandoned, betrayed, offended or deceived, or ""cuckolded"". Because thinking that being ""cuckolded"" by his wife, humiliated by his wife, cheated by his wife... will make his suffering even more painful.

Impermanence is that, it is a natural law, whether we like it or not, they still happen every day, every minute, every second, every tick of time.

1.0,measuring a boy's reaction to being… confessed,measur boy reaction confess,"Essentially, one only considers observable behaviors—things like perceptions, emotions, and moods, which are difficult to examine. Behaviorism was officially founded in 1913 with the publication of John B. Watson's analysis titled ""Psychology from the Behaviorist's Perspective"". (Psychology from a behaviorist's point of view). The entire analysis was carried out by Watson, who is considered the ""father"" of behavioral theory. So what is behavioral psychology? Simply put, purely behavioral psychologists believe that all behavior is the result of experience. Anyone, regardless of their educational background, can be trained in some way with the right conditions of impact. From about 1920 to the mid-1950s, behaviorism began to become the dominant school of thought in psychology. Some argue that the popularity of behavioral psychology has gone beyond the mere desire to construct psychology as an objective and measurable discipline. See also: Insomnia – Causes of memory loss Researchers are focused on creating measurable and descriptive theories that are empirically based but still have to be created. Many contributions have an impact on people's daily lives. Classical conditioning is a technique commonly used in behavioral training. This is now known as the conditioned stimulus and the resulting behavior is known as the conditioned response. Outcome conditioning (sometimes called media conditioning) is a learning method that is acquired through reinforcement and punishment agents. With resultant conditioning, a link is formed between a behavior and its outcome. When a positive result is achieved after performing an action, the action is likely to reappear in the future. In contrast, reactions that lead to negative outcomes are less likely to repeat in the future. There are quite a few therapeutic techniques that have their roots in behavioral psychology. What was behavioral psychology when it ceased to flourish after 1950? It still serves as the foundational doctrine, but its principles are still very important. Even today, behavioral analysis is often used as a therapeutic technique to help autistic and mentally retarded children learn new skills. It usually involves profiling (rewarding desired behavior) and sequencing (breaking work into smaller chunks and teaching and chaining next steps together). Other behavioral therapy techniques include aversion therapy, systematic desensitization, economic reward, modeling, and positive behavior management. One of behavioral psychology's greatest strengths is its ability to clearly observe and measure behavior. The limitations of this approach are that it cannot analyze the internal cognitive and physiological processes that influence behavior. Although behaviorism is no longer as dominant as it once was, it still has a major impact on our understanding of human psychology. Conditioning itself helps us understand many different types of behavior, from how humans learn to the development of language. But perhaps behavioral psychology's greatest contribution lies in its practical applicability. Its techniques can play a powerful role in correcting problem behaviors and encouraging more positive and productive behaviors. In addition to psychology, parents, teachers, animal trainers, and many others can use the fundamentals of behavioral psychology, understanding what behavioral psychology is to help train behaviors. new positives and limit undesirable behaviors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2.0,"half life left, learn how to be the ultimate winner",half life left learn ultim winner,"The more we grow up and experience life, the more deeply we understand the morals for the ultimate winner. If you want to know if your life is successful, don't ask ""Is my career good?"", ""Is my career okay"", ""Is my marriage and family good?"", “Are my children good?”…but ask yourself: “Are you in a good mood?” Men's attitudes affect career, women's attitudes affect marriage. So, the more you grow up and experience life, the more you have to understand that your attitude can decide everything. Keep a good attitude, everything around will be fine. But to maintain a good attitude, we must know ""Talk less, think more"" and understand 7 valuable lessons of life as follows: Admit Mistakes seem to be a challenge for anyone, especially those in pursuit of victory, but making mistakes does not mean failure, failure is the result of a conscious but unsuccessful effort. When it comes to success, mistakes can be accidental, sometimes it's not really your fault, but knowing how to take responsibility for yourself is also a way to turn mistakes into advantages for yourself to become a successful person in the end. That's when our state of mind becomes serene, calm, receptive and tolerant of ourselves and those around us. No matter how hard teeth are, they will eventually fall out, and soft tongues. Traders who seem more vulnerable can still live for the rest of their lives. Therefore, if you want to live a long and good life, learn to behave gently, peacefully and calmly. When we become more moderate, the tendency to work will be more cautious, less impulsive and always look at things from many directions before acting. Showing calmness, gentleness from personality to facial expressions, outward gestures is also a method of training patience It is also a method of training patience and showing respect to others. around. It is also one of the important steps, to become the ultimate winner. Take a step back, the sky is high and the sea is wide; Wait an hour, the waves are calm and the wind is calm. If you know ""Forbearance"", everything can be solved with wisdom and calm mind. Turning big things into small, turning small things into not the best way to survive, to practice tolerance and the ability to treat others. With understanding comes faith. But in order to be understood by others, you must first listen and understand the other's feelings. If speaking to each other without clarity or understanding, the speaker must have a listener, sooner or later misunderstandings will arise, causing unnecessary enmity. Successful people in life are always by their side, there are always people who understand their every thought and action. Therefore, in communication, the most important thing is the ability to understand and care for each other. We apply our experience, put in the case of others to consider from many angles. Only then will we know how to empathize and communicate effectively with each other. In many ways, we can see that successful people are just like ordinary people. They all have the same education or experience from the same starting point. But if we take a closer look, we can clearly see that successful people in life will always have people who understand their every thought and action. Thanks to such people, they themselves are truly successful in life and gradually become the ultimate winners. Letting go does not mean denying or avoiding one's responsibilities, but it must make us live more earnestly, more compassionately, more altruistically, more open-mindedly and learn many new things. Letting go when absolutely necessary is also one of the laws of nature in this life. Since then we feel free, no longer attached, no longer burdened in the heart, the state of mind will achieve a state of peace and serenity. If you let go, your heart will be open, whoever says anything will ignore it, whoever offends easily forgives, if there is anger, it only takes a few minutes, a few hours. One night when you wake up, you can forget all your worries and let your mind be at peace. However, letting go does not mean denying or avoiding the responsibility of a human being, but must make us live more passionately, more compassionately, more altruistically and more open-mindedly, and learn many new things. Seeing your friends reap the rewards, vent your anger and congratulate them cheerfully. Look at good people and good deeds around, let go of doubts and feel the emotions from within.

5.0,behavioral psychology theories of personality are popular in the world,behavior psycholog theori person popular world,"S. Freud is a famous Austrian psychoanalyst. His system of reasoning was the first orthodox theory of personality, which had a profound influence on later theories of psychology of personality behavior. When it comes to personality, he introduced the concepts of the unconscious, the personality structure, and the stages of personality formation and development. He affirmed, human personality is built and shaped from the age of 5, this is the most important stage that determines the entire development of a person's life. Freud emphasized the stages of childhood, emphasizing the dominance of instinctive, biological factors. Carl Jung is a person born in Switzerland. He is considered the successor of Freud's theories. Although exploiting and analyzing based on Freud's personality-behavior psychology, the theory that Jung extended and developed has different directions from Freud's theory. C. Jung gave another interpretation of the nature of Libido, and outlined a system of basic components of personality. Regarding the nature of Libido, Freud suggested that it is the sexual energy, the most powerful type of energy, that has a significant influence on one's life. Jung considered LIbido to be a vast and indistinguishable kind of life energy. It is a kind of spiritually stimulating mystical energy. It is through mental strength that conscious activities are carried out. Regarding the components of personality, Jung suggested that include: The ego, the center of consciousness, is the perception of self and is responsible for carrying out normal activities in life. Personal unconscious, once conscious but forgotten or erased because of inconsequential or minor annoyance. All kinds of personal experiences are accumulated in the personal unconscious, which can only be used by mental effort and put back into place. Collective unconscious, Jung argued that if each of us accumulates all of our experiences in the individual unconscious, then humanity is like a collection of all kinds of accumulating human experiences. This legacy is passed on to each new generation. Any experience that is global, repetitive, and relatively unchanged from generation to generation becomes part of our personality. The collective unconscious is expressed through archetypes, common and symbolic archetypes such as God, mother, hero, etc. Alfred Adler is a great contributor to the content of psychological theory. about their personality to Psychology in general and other social disciplines in particular. In his theory, he mentioned that inferiority complex and the birth order of children in a family affect the personality of each child. According to Adler, guilt is feeling inferior to others. This inferiority can stem from low self-esteem in body shape, ability to cope with difficulties in life. He assumes that everyone has this common state. There are 3 main causes leading to inferiority complex including: Body inferiority complex; The pampered person; indifference… The way people overcome these complexes will shape and determine the direction of that person's personality development. Regarding the birth order of children in the family, Adler believes that this birth order has a significant influence on the formation and development of a person's personality. Each different position can lead to guilt, different psychological features among children in the same family. Gordon Allport was the first to introduce a clear, specific concept of personality, which greatly contributed to the behavioral psychology of personality. At the same time, he also introduced the concept of personality traits, motivation and personality development process. He argued that personality is not simply an accumulation of psychophysiological systems but a dynamic combination and interaction of psychophysiological systems expressed and determined through behavior and behaviour. typical thinking. The personalities of two people are two separate personalities, each with their own personality, no one is the same. Allport introduced the concept of personality traits, which are predispositions to how we respond to environmental stimuli. They are consistent, enduring strokes of how to react to the environment. Personality traits include: Essential personality traits; Central personality traits; Secondary Personality Traits These personality traits exist within each of us and they determine or cause behavior. They not only stem from responding to a stimulus, but also motivate us to find appropriate ways and then interact with the environment to induce behavior. They are related to each other and represent different characteristics. BF Skinner is one of the typical representatives of the School of Behavioral Psychology. He was the one who extended and developed the theory of behavior more deeply. From conducting his famous mouse cage experiment, he introduced important concepts such as fabrication, reinforcement, punishment, and especially, in the behavioral psychology of personality, he argued that personality is the sum total of manipulative acts. Artifactual behavior is behavior that is understood as a type of behavior produced by its own action. The formation and development of personality is the formation, maintenance and change of a system of artifactual behaviors to create a stable and separate personality. It is the act of making up requests for reinforcement. Reinforcement includes positive and negative reinforcement. And integral to Skinner's behavioral theory is the concept of punishment. Punishment is fundamentally different from negative reinforcement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5.0,"in marital love, there are 3 things women want to do; 3 things men need",marit love thing woman want thing men need,"Happiness does not happen by chance, if not cultivated, it will one day wither. Husband and wife who want to live happily, love each other deeply every day need to focus on nurturing love in marriage from very small things. Surely anyone, whether married or about to get married, has asked this question in mind: What is the secret to a happy marriage? The question is extremely popular but until now people still have a headache to find the real correct answer. As husband and wife, the wife needs to know 3 things her husband needs, and the husband should also understand the 3 things his wife wants, so that the marriage will last. Some people value and put husband and wife relationship first in marriage. Yes, love is really important for two people to gradually understand each other, love and decide to be together, but love is not the first and only thing in a marriage. According to psychologists, a lasting marriage is based on two prerequisites: understanding and responsiveness. Therefore, if they do not understand each other, do not meet each other's needs, the marriage will sooner or later die prematurely. As husband and wife, the wife needs to know 3 things her husband needs, and the husband should also understand the 3 things his wife wants, so that the marriage will last. Men outside call the rain and call the wind, respected by everyone for their talent and strength. They are like horses running tirelessly, always wanting to explore new lands, but eventually the horse will find a place to stay. Men always yearn for a place to return to, a clean, tidy house, full of children's laughter, a bed warm enough to lie back on after hard days. The house will be the place to have a hot, fragrant family meal, with a wife smiling tenderly asking if her husband is tired, happy or sad today. Men need a home like that to return to, to be comforted, to be comforted, to be a motivation for them to keep trying. Women when getting married often expect long-term, passionate and intense love, and men when getting married just need respect. For women, the sweetest word is ""I love you"". For men, sweet is when the wife can say thank you, praise and be proud of them. Men need their wives to believe in what they do. They need a solid rear, always comforting and encouraging when encountering failures and difficulties. Women should remember that praising and recognizing husband's efforts and efforts is never superfluous. Men always want to receive respect and admiration and as long as their woman places their trust, they will try their best not to let her down. Men are born with many ambitions to conquer and explore. They need the freedom to develop themselves, to do what they want, whether single or married. Women should remember, do not turn the family into a prison, children are shackles that inhibit the development of men. Men need their own space, enough strength to struggle and just enough to want to return home. A wise woman is actively beautifying to seduce her husband, leaving a man free to find what he wants, within a safe framework. What women want – Feeling safe, protected, loved In marriage, there's nothing better than having someone by your side, listening and sharing your problems, problems, and difficulties. the life I'm facing. The husband may not be able to resolve all their feelings, but as long as the husband cares and actively listens to the voice of his wife's heart, they will feel safe and strong enough to move on. It will be suffocating if two people live together without finding a common voice, not listening to each other and thinking only of themselves without putting themselves in the position of others to understand. No matter how strong a woman is, she will forever need a man to rely on. For women, marriage is an asset, so they need to feel safe, protected and loved. And what they are most afraid of is not poverty and hardship, but the heartless husband who does not care about family life and children. What women need sometimes is just a handshake, a hug when they are tired, asked by their husbands, cared for... Simply, women need to feel cared for, someone to share with them. Men who do not pay attention to these little things will one day realize that their wives are no longer with them. Housework is not something only women can do or only women have to do. Everyone has their own job, but when they come home, why are only women hunched over in the kitchen? Men can go out and make money, so can women. So when women do housework, men should also lend a hand. Only bad men think housework is only a woman's job. Women, no matter how tolerant, want their husbands to help with housework to show their husband's love for his wife. Although they can do everything by themselves, women need the care and sharing from their husbands. It is equality that should be taken care of in love marriage so that the woman does not feel burdened and stressed. Marriage is the grave of love, but it is the grave of those who love and marry by mistake! Someone once said, ""An unhappy marriage is not because of a lack of love, but because of a lack of friendship"". Therefore, the ideal marriage relationship is a harmonious combination of love, family and friendship. He is both a relative, a lover, and a friend. Only then can we understand, care and share everything in life. The more harmonious the relationship, the happier the marriage. In your opinion, what is a happy marriage?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That is shown most clearly in her, our mother in the daily care of her husband and children. Even Miss Vietnam 2014 also chose this personality to win the behavior contest that year. With the rapid change of modern culture today plus the introduction of Western culture into Vietnam, there are many arguments that this virtue shows a girl's psychology in a positive direction. or negative. Some people think that this sacrifice shows the weakness, resignation and general weakness of women. Another opinion is that the sacrifices of Vietnamese girls and women are noble and worthy of respect.

5.0,decoding the psychology of love lightning,decod psycholog love lightn,"How long does it take to love someone? Have you ever seen someone, and immediately felt attracted to them, even stunned, ecstatic? In this article, we will help you decipher the psychology of lightning love. If you watch a lot of movies or romantic movies, you will come across many situations where the male lead or female lead is attracted to the other person at the first meeting and from there fall in love. Then gradually you begin to believe in “lightning love” or “lightning love”. But does that really exist? Does lightning love really exist or is it simply a trick of reason? Have you ever seen someone and instantly felt attracted? It feels like an electric current runs through your body, your heart is pounding, your limbs are shaking, you're sweating… in just 0.2 seconds and you feel… you're in love. You could call it “love at first sight,” but psychologists who study the psychology of love lightning call it a completely different name: “the attractive halo effect.” For example, when you see a very handsome, manly looking guy, sometimes your brain immediately makes a judgment: he must be as interesting and attractive as he looks. Several scientific studies conducted in recent years on the psychology of lightning love have concluded that lightning love is real and not paranoid. This state occurs due to the release of chemicals in the brain that affect intellectual and cognitive function, creating feelings of euphoria. Most scientists refer to love as a basic emotion, but in the study of professor Stephanie Ortigue (Syracuse University, USA) on the psychology of love lightning, she and her colleagues discovered. The brain has 12 nerve regions that work together to send out catalysts and hormones that cause the feeling of ""heart pounding"" in just 0.2 seconds. These are dopamine, oxytocin, adrenaline and vasopressin. These complex catalysts and hormones are mixed together like a ""love drug"", causing a feeling of faster heart beat, even euphoria similar to cocaine use. According to the psychology of love at first sight, when a man falls in love with a woman at first sight, he will find ways to flirt and convince the girl even if she hasn't yet. love herself, but very rarely do women try. to convince men to love them. Love at first sight is not uncommon. Therefore, if you ""fall in love"" or have feelings for someone at the first meeting, it is not an exception. It may not be the only and forever love in your life but it will certainly make you remember for a long time. However, before discussing love at first sight, there is a fact that the attraction and impression on the other person at the first meeting will disappear when you understand the other better and realize the initial ""illusion"". mine is not the same as reality. at all. Understanding the psychology of love lightning, you still need to remember that love will not simply form at first meeting. Each of us has different conceptions of love, but only a few believe that they can find love just by… looking at someone. Because do you ever give or take something at first sight? Love needs more than that, it's empathy, understanding and patience. However, the psychology of lightning love proves that you can't completely deny that first feelings can turn into true love. The first time you see someone, you may immediately want to get closer to them, learn more about them. And as the relationship progresses, the initial feelings naturally have a chance to develop into love. It is a mistake to think that a first sight without intense emotions is not love. Because many strong relationships always come from roads that are not romantic like in Korean movies, and folk still have a saying: ""Fire near straw also burns after a long time"". - love can be cultivated through effort and time. More importantly, the psychological halo effect of lightning love can be dangerous. If you see someone very attractive and mistakenly think that you have a crush on that person, you will surely overlook the things that really exist inside that person, and then hurt yourself if one day you realize Everything is not what you think it is. That means you gave the other person a chance to play with your heart. You may or may not believe in lightning love, although the psychology of lightning love has proven its existence. But the important thing is not to expect one day there will be a thunderbolt of love in your life. Falling in love can be a good sign, but it can also be just a fantasy that you should think realistically. Because to understand a person will take more time than 1 meeting many times.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5.0,halo effect: real or not catching watch faces?,halo effect real catch watch face,"The halo effect is a type of cognitive bias. This effect can affect our value of a person from their overall feeling or impression. The halo effect is a type of cognitive bias. For example, your overall impression of a person (“He is nice”) will influence your assessment of that person (“He is also smart”). A great example of this halo effect is our impression of a celebrity. Because we consider them attractive, successful, and likable, we tend to think of them as smart, kind, and funny. Psychologist Edward Thorndike first coined the term in a 1920 paper titled ""Continuity Errors in Psychological Ratings"". In the experiment described in the paper, Thorndike asked military commanders to rate a range of qualities in junior soldiers. Traits assessed included leadership, appearance, intelligence, loyalty, and dependability. So why does our overall impression of a person create a halo effect – “halo” He discovered that having one quality ranked high leads to several other qualities ranking well. high rank. , while if there are things that are rated negatively, some characteristics will also be rated lower. So why does our general impression of a person create a halo effect, affecting our assessment of particular traits? Researchers have found here that there is a role of attraction. Many other researchers have found that if a person is judged to be good-looking, we tend to believe that they have a positive and intelligent personality. One study even found that jurors were less likely to believe that handsome, handsome people committed crimes. In the classroom, teachers may experience this effect on student assessment. For example, a student with good manners is also often judged as smart and diligent by the teacher before the teacher begins to assess specific competencies. Besides, when halo effects occur, they can somewhat affect a teacher's assessment of students, even a student's score. Impact can affect how teachers treat students and also students' evaluations of teachers This impact can affect how teachers treat students and also students' evaluations about teachers. One study found that a teacher who was warm and friendly was often rated as more attractive, engaging, and likable. In the working environment, the halo effect affects the evaluation of the work of superiors with subordinates. In fact, the halo effect is the most common cause of deviations in performance ratings. Managers can promote a unique characteristic of an employee, such as enthusiasm. This can completely make the remaining reviews more positive due to the effect of this effect. For example, although this employee may lack the knowledge or ability to do the job well, if he shows enthusiasm, his superiors will happily judge his achievements. he is superior to inherent knowledge or ability. It is also easy for the candidate to feel the impact of this effect. . Marketers can take advantage of the halo effect to sell products and services. When a celebrity becomes the brand representative for a particular product, that individual's positive publicity can influence consumers' perception of the product itself. It is also easy for the candidate to feel the impact of this effect. If employers find a candidate attractive or good-looking, they are also more likely to judge the individual as an intelligent, competent, and qualified person than those with less looks.

The wounds you suffer are like the cuts of a knife that is not sharp enough. Every time it cuts into your heart, it's slow, it's gentle, but it causes you indescribable pain. Because you used to think ""a good person like him won't hurt me"", when you face that pain, there is no way you can get over it. You do not learn to take precautions, give yourself a way out, so when you get hurt, you suffer twice as much. So don't fall in love with a man who is too good. When a girl's love for a guy is too good, it also means that you have to try hard to become more perfect, more worthy of him. You'll have to do things you don't like, wear things that are weird to you, or try to fit in with that guy's world. You are no longer yourself just because you have to change and live your life to match your too good guy. Think about it, what is the meaning of forced love, sacrificing so much privacy? I have a friend who always talks about her love in a proud voice. But while you were passionately telling stories, I saw in your eyes the fatigue, your thin bodies sometimes trembled slightly. I was startled to realize, my friend was much thinner than before, no longer the lively, cheerful girl of the day. I asked if it was okay, but my friend said that because her lover is a vegetarian, she also has to try to be a vegetarian with him. While my friend's body was inherently weak and malnourished. I couldn't understand how good that guy was that his poor, sick lover didn't know and prevented my friend from going vegan. Girls don't fall in love with a good guy. You will hurt yourself over and over again or just because you never suspect, even think about his nefarious actions. You find ways to deceive yourself, always creating excuses to justify his not replying to texts, not answering his phone, or sitting in the back of a strange girl's car. You turn yourself into a puppet in love, having no opinions, not daring to speak up, not even being questioned – the most basic right of a person when in love. Daughter do not fall in love with a very good guy When you love a very good guy, you always have the thought that things will progress in the most favorable direction. Therefore, every mistake of a lover, big or small, is easily forgiven. You refuse to save yourself while love is slowly falling into a deep hole because you think he will be the one to go through all the difficulties with you, but where is that too good guy at that time? you need the most? Not to mention, the guy who can be nice to you can also be nice to other girls. Enthusiasm is not a crime, of course, but excessive enthusiasm should be reconsidered. When a guy has a lover but still notices another girl, still willing to drive her home even though there are dozens of other people around, still texting her every night just to make her less lonely . … is that guy still good? Love a person too much, you have to learn to accept all his reasons and unusual actions, are you tired? You know, there's no movie or story that can tell you how sad or hurt you would be if you loved a guy so well. In the minds of most of us, only bad boys make girls cry for love. However, reality proves the opposite. Although not the majority, good or bad men do not determine his love for you will be 100% smooth. A lot of guys labeled ""bad boys"" get better when they meet the right girl, and conversely, guys are always sought after by all girls for their kindness. turned out to be the most ruthless, cold-blooded people in love. When others look at your love, they only see the flashy, beautiful things on the outside, all the pain and joy inside, no one can know but you. You are the one who understands best, feels the best about what you have, whether your love is reciprocated or not. As a girl, don't take a guy who is too good as a criterion for choosing a lover.

The first and most common reason for men's infidelity is often attributed to ""nature"". The first and most common reason for men's infidelity is often attributed to ""nature"". Scientists think it's a biological problem. Since ancient times, in order to maintain the race, the man's mentality often tends to have relationships with many women besides his official wife. People still say ""the strange is equal to the familiar"". Even the other man is ugly, inferior to his wife in all aspects, but superior to his wife in novelty, many husbands are willing to betray their wives and children to run after that wrong love. As in a survey by Gary Neuman - author of the book The Truth About Infidelity - only 8% of men cheat because they are dissatisfied or disappointed with their sex life with their wives. Men often find it difficult to feel satisfied with what they have and have recently achieved. They always want more, more and more. Even with a wife and children, men still want to experience how to flirt, 'fall for' women and that is the only way to satisfy them. Not only want to conquer in career and fame, men also want the feeling of conquering in love. Even though he has a wife and children, men still want to experience the feeling of flirting, 'beating' women and that is the only way for them to feel satisfied. See also: 59 Things He Wants You To Do But Never Say. Another reason is that over time, married life causes a woman to change, becoming easygoing and self-indulgent, no longer taking care of herself as she did when she first fell in love. They cause what used to be attractive to men to seriously decline with the years of marriage. This makes men realize they are living under the same roof with someone completely different from the one they initially fell in love with. It is also one of the reasons that men's mistresses are often beautiful and young. When a man no longer finds his woman beautiful and attractive, sex is not as hot as it once was. Quite a few men are willing to sit back, patiently tell their wife these things and offer solutions for her to correct, reduce her dissatisfaction. Instead, they choose to leave the house and find fun outside. It is also one of the reasons that men's mistresses are often beautiful and young. Men do not live purely by reason, they are also easily influenced by emotions, also have the need to be cared for and spoiled. The problem is, unlike women, men often find it difficult to express their feelings and emotional needs. Because with the male mentality, showing those things makes them lose their masculinity. So women often don't understand what men think. Women often think that men live rationally and simply emotionally. Therefore, women often do not pay attention to the feelings of men, but only care about their own feelings. Once a man feels lonely in his own relationship, he becomes depressed. As long as someone cares about them more, they will find that person to replace. If the woman, because of that pressure, often nags, instead of understanding, then quarrels and disputes, then gradually the man will get tired. Family life is different from the youth. They have to shoulder many responsibilities, earn money to take care of their family, take care of their children's education and future. If the woman, because of that pressure, often nags, instead of understanding, then quarrels and disputes, then gradually the man will get tired. They have enough pressure already, it is not necessary to have a wife to put more pressure on themselves. So the only way to ""run away"" is to find another woman who understands and isn't mad at them. A surprising number also in the survey by Gary Neuman, up to 77% of cheating men have close friends, or hang out with friends who also cheat. Communicating, sharing with the adulterer will gradually make them feel that it is completely normal. Moreover, if you accidentally play with a group of friends who like to tease like ""Men who don't commit adultery are weak"", ""Just play, don't be shy"" will gradually form an opinion. In the beginning, it was natural for men to look for outside happiness. The highest likelihood of adultery is between men and female colleagues. The highest likelihood of adultery is between men and female colleagues. With almost an entire day together, sharing and solving all his problems, regularly praising his success, understanding the pressures he faces, that will be the woman Women make men feel appreciated. Temptation from a person who has the same thoughts as him is often something that can easily move men's psyche and cannot be overcome. And the simplest reason is to fall out of love. Time is intangible but corrosive. Having been together for a long time, he suddenly felt that he no longer had feelings for him, but could not get rid of the longing so he said goodbye. So men choose to find another place where they feel loved. Do men regret betraying their women? The mentality of most men, they don't think that one day they will betray their wives, they will feel guilty and wish they hadn't. However, guilt compared to the above problems is not enough to stop men from betraying. And very few men can actually go home!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Men who fall in love with this type of woman will one day fall into the situation of being ""pickpocketed"" to the point of exhaustion and by that time, what they have left is just… two empty hands. If she encounters a girl whose knack is to cry, make a fuss and then ask… to hang herself, surely her man sometimes just wants… to explode. With these women, as long as she finds out that her man has betrayed her a little, she will threaten the other person to death.

The remarkable achievements at work have given them absolute confidence, making them forget the tenderness when standing in front of their man. No one criticizes a talented woman, but if that woman knows how to harmonize between work and family, this will be an extremely ideal model for men. These people always want to be at the center of everything and of course, few can tolerate that, unless they have a completely different attitude in work as well as in family life.

4.0,"are high expectations of a relationship a ""should"" or a ""shouldn't""?",high expect relationship nt,"We all have expectations of love when we enter a relationship, but at times, you should also ask yourself if your expectations will help your relationship to be happy and lasting. long or not. Are not? When people enter a relationship, especially when they love someone, they often think and imagine big things about their future. Gradually it creates expectations in love. And sometimes that is what makes them miserable. According to a 2017 study in the journal Psychology Today on the impact of these expectations on romantic relationships, our hearts tend to set the following types of expectations: 1) Connection expectations: How do you expect the other person to feel and understand you? feelings and thoughts? 2) Expectations of passion: What do you expect of each other's charm and attractiveness? 3) Expectations about the outcome of love: Do you believe that what you both have is due to fate or is it the result of a nurturing process? 4) Expectations of love growth rate: What do you think about the rate of love growth of both? Do you want a long-lasting love when two people start fast or slow? As you can imagine, everyone's love expectations are different. Some people start relationships with a desire to share. Others carry their inherent independent selves. Expectations in love like these often manifest in the way they see themselves and their partners. The problem with these expectations is often not what you expect from the other person, but how much the other person meets your expectations. It is also from here that many love affairs break up when both cannot reconcile expectations and reality. So, sometimes I think that without love, I can live well alone because no one loves without hope, without waiting. But the truth is that the more expectations are, the more unsatisfactory they are, how can both? Expectations in love are inevitable when entering a romantic relationship. You will definitely be disappointed. You will always wonder what you did wrong. You are just thinking too much. Think about it… When you were a kid, one day you came back from the market, your mother suddenly bought you a dish that you liked very much without warning. Surely you will be very happy with that unexpected joy. Then you just go ahead, next time you go to the market, your mother will definitely buy you such an item. But next time, mom doesn't buy. As I rummaged through my mother's basket, I knew there was nothing special for me. Surely a feeling of disappointment and disappointment will overwhelm you. You will ask your mother: What did you do poorly today, but why didn't you have a gift? But after a few times like that, you no longer expect much from your mother's gifts, and suddenly you are no longer sad or disappointed. As an adult, you shouldn't put too much expectations on relationships. Don't be under the illusion that they are more special than others, they are no longer the same, they will be like this and they will not hurt you. Then one day, suddenly the relationship makes you feel lost, frustrated and confused: why is that? The two of you should tell each other the things that are agreeable and also the things that you both feel are not really okay in this relationship. Expectations in love are inevitable when entering any romantic relationship. However, love is inherently determined by both the heart and the mind. So, balancing our own expectations with reality is something we should consider to have a lasting love. As we begin to have expectations of others, we also begin to evaluate and compare whether they are meeting those expectations. What we should do now is not necessarily give up those expectations, but change to have more reasonable expectations, helping the relationship to last. The “right” expectations reflect your true self-worth and help you lead and develop a positive relationship. The two of you should tell each other the things that are agreeable and also the things that you both feel are not really okay in this relationship. It also helps you realize if two people have the potential to go further and bond more in love. If you're still feeling a little shaky in your thoughts and feelings, don't hesitate to talk to someone else to make sure you're looking forward to the relationship. That is completely reasonable. For example, just because your partner doesn't spend all of his time with you doesn't mean he doesn't love you very much. You have your own relationships, interests, and lives, and so does he. He is completely entitled to do his usual activities before falling in love with you: playing games, meeting old colleagues, going out to eat with friends, attending company gatherings. You cannot and should not ban it. Casual love is inherently complicated as long as he doesn't leave you alone, makes sure you are prioritized enough, still makes sure you're the first and last person he thinks of. About a very happy day, my daughter! So whether you are male or female! Stop placing too many expectations in love on the person you love because that will make the other half tired and pressured. Don't dream of a perfect love in a romantic movie. Perfection is only in imagination, not in real life. And the person you love is not the main actor in a melodrama. You should remember that you and the person you love are two independent individuals. And before falling in love with you, that person also had a completely different perspective and life. Marriage is the grave of love, but it is the grave of those who love and marry by mistake. Ordinary love is inherently a very complicated thing. So, when in love, let's relax a little, sympathize with each other a little to have a little more fun. And to be happy, it's best not to put too much expectation on love in the other person because that will only make both of you feel more tired.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5.0,nearly 5% of men in the world are depressed at this stage,nearli men world depress stage,"The birth of a child is both a joy and a stressful time for parents. Sadly, up to 10-15% of women experience postpartum depression. However, few people know the fact that the same form of depression also occurs in many fathers. Sarah Kittel-Schneider, associate director of the Psychiatric and Psychological Clinic at Frankfurt University Hospital, told Business Insider that postpartum depression has similar symptoms to other forms of depression, i.e., total disorder. mind. Both mood and motivation are affected, with loss of interest in life lasting at least about two weeks. “The difference between postpartum depression and other forms of depression is that above all, they have a baby to take care of,” she said. Those affected often have many fears for the child. They often feel extremely guilty if they cannot take good care of their children. People with major depression may even worry that they won't be able to love their baby."" It's not clear exactly how many people are affected by postpartum depression because statistics in different studies fall within between 3% and 20%, but Kittel-Schneider estimates about 5% of fathers require treatment for the disease. Analysis by James Paulson and Sharnail Bazemore of the East Virginia School of Medicine concluded that while women often struggle with this condition shortly after giving birth, men are at higher risk from third to third This could be due to exhaustion over a long period of time, especially for fathers having to work for money Spousal and social relationships can worsen depression it is not necessary to have a medical history to develop depression This is often accompanied by the onset of depression. important life events, both negative and positive.It's not just mothers who experience hormonal changes during pregnancy and after childbirth, but fathers too. Decreased testosterone hormone levels in men after their wives give birth may be responsible for the mother's postpartum depression. When the mother is pregnant, the father's body produces more prolactin hormone and less testosterone, so their mood is also somewhat more vulnerable. This empathy phenomenon is known as Couvade syndrome. Some studies have shown that if the wife has postpartum depression, it is also easy to drag the husband to the same disease. This may involve the father taking on more responsibility if the mother is depressed. A man has to work, take care of young children, worry about his spouse and support as much as he can to heal, all of these add to stress, leading to another form of depression. Depression is ""burnout"". Basically, when men are depressed, they do not appear sad or melancholy but are very irritable and aggressive. According to experts, often they will find a cure by looking to alcohol. The situation can become especially dire if both parents are depressed. Kittel-Schneider says the condition can destroy the parent-child relationship. As children grow up, they will be more prone to behavioral disorders and mental illnesses such as anxiety, depression, and even alcohol and drug addiction. Parental depression can negatively impact a child's development, both cognitively and psychologically. The sooner you get up to fight depression, the better your chance of a cure. The best approach is often a combination of psychotherapy and medication, prescriptions given every half year. Their biggest problem is not seeking or accepting treatment out of shame. They always want to be strong and a solid support for the family. Currently, experts are continuing to research to help fathers with depression after their wives give birth and widely propagate and educate about this condition.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4.0,when psychology of behavior is affected by living environment,psycholog behavior affect live environ,"In the early 1970s, a team of researchers in the US dropped hundreds of stamped, addressable letters into dormitories along the East Coast and recorded the number of lost letters returned. correct mailbox. The researchers considered sending mail to the correct address a small act of kindness and found one thing: students in some buildings behaved more kindly than others. Nearly all the mail that fell when the dorm was empty - where only a few students lived on each floor - was sent to the correct address. In contrast, only about 6 out of 10 letters sent near crowded dormitories reach their recipients. Obviously, students who live in more crowded places where people are closer together are less likely to care about their classmates, and this obviously reduces their generosity. Then, when the researchers asked the students how would they react if they encountered a lost letter? 95% responded that they would give it back, no matter where they live. In fact, most people think they are kind. In a self-assessment study, people often described themselves as kind, friendly, and sincere. We imagine these traits as a set of enduring attributes that make us who we are. But the truth is, we are like chameleons, our behavior changing instinctively and unintentionally, based on our surroundings. Consider another experiment conducted in 2000. A group of contractors in Glasgow, Scotland installed green lights at several prominent locations in the city. The purpose of this was to make the city's less beautiful districts more attractive to tourists, but after a few months, the city's crime figures showed a notable trend: billions dollars. Crime rates in places where the green light is given has dropped significantly. The blue light is reminiscent of the lights on the hood of a police car, making people feel like the police are watching them. In 2005, the police of Nara Prefecture, Japan, installed green lights in crime hotspots and obtained similar results: the overall crime rate dropped. When other places adopted this approach, they found that littering and suicide also decreased under the blue light. There are many explanations for how blue light deters crime: perhaps it's brighter and more attention-grabbing, making dark places more visible - or maybe blue light can can make dark places easier to see. a magical effect that calms people down. But even smaller-scale interventions have similar results. People behave more kindly and honestly where they feel like they are being watched. A psychology research team at the University of Newcastle in southeastern England has found that school staff will pay for tea and coffee if there is an image of a pair of eyes on the payment box below the price tag. If the collection box was shaped like a flower, fewer people would be willing to pay. The scientists altered images of different eyes and flowers over the course of 10 weeks of practice, using images of both men's and women's eyes, to ensure that there was no particular image. which is affected. to the final result. On the weeks that the box is labeled with the eyes, the number in the box will be more. This research led police in the West Midlands, England, to place large posters depicting the eyes around the town where, according to reports, the crime rate has dropped. The mirror has a similar effect and is said to be even more effective, as it metaphorically forces us to look directly into our souls. Other external cues influence our actions because they give us signals that allow us to behave badly. According to the controversial broken window theory, people who live in neighborhoods with a lot of broken windows are more likely to commit crimes, even if they are decent people. Because broken windows are a signal that people here don't care about their property. The authors of this theory, James Q. Wilson and George L. Kelling, assumed in a 1982 article for The Atlantic Weekly that, if a broken window in a building is left untreated, people will tend to destroy other doorways. And this will eventually encourage more vandalism. The same thing happened in the garbage-filled walking tunnel experiment. The more garbage there is in the cellar, the more people will litter. Eventually, people started to throw away bags or tissues from restaurants there, and gradually crime would occur in neglected areas. Since 1982, when professors Wilson and Kelling put forward their theory, the litter theory has been bolstered by much practical evidence. In one study, social psychologists posted flyers on 139 cars in a hospital garage and observed what owners did with the flyers. Again, the environment shapes behavior. When motorists came out of the hospital and found the garage full of trash, flyers, candy wrappers, and coffee cups (all arranged by the researcher, of course), nearly half of the people threw the flyers. fell into their car. his own to the ground. In contrast, when the researchers swept the floor, only 1 in 10 people threw the flyer on the floor. Naturally, drivers choose the behavior that seems to best match their perception of their surroundings. These studies reveal something profound, and perhaps a little disturbing, about what makes us who we are: you and I are not just one person. While we all have distinct personalities, external cues sometimes make us behave so differently from ourselves, that sometimes it's hard to define who we really are, Or at least, who we are. what to do in a certain situation. We have always been comfortable with the belief that each person has a unique nature: good people behave well, bad people act evil, and our inclinations to be good or bad are all up to us. But evidence is increasingly proving that, to some extent, our nature - good citizens or irresponsible - will change over time, depending on the environment at the time. Signals from the environment can shape and change us even as we move from one location to another in the city.

2.0,how to avoid verbal abuse,avoid verbal abus,"Verbal abuse is a way of attacking, terrorizing, or hurting an opponent with words or indifferent silence. Verbal abuse manifests in a variety of ways, from unnecessary bragging to passive-aggressive behavior. Common forms of Verbal Violence include knowingly disclosing information about another's thoughts and feelings; refute the other's thoughts and experiences; blame the other party for unintended things; use disparaging words to criticize others, calling them fools, clowns, opportunists. Verbal abuse often occurs in romantic relationships, friends, and family. But it can also happen between co-workers and relatives. Even people who don't know each other can engage in Verbal Violence. Verbal abuse is a branch of psycho-emotional abuse. The opposite of it are non-verbal psychological abuses such as staring, glaring and slamming doors, slandering the victim, slandering others, using personal power to force the victim to do. Follow me. Verbal and psychological abuse is never the right thing to do. If you feel you have been treated unfairly, you should not immediately identify it as abuse. Instead, slowly explain to the other person how their actions make you feel, and express your willingness to resolve conflicts with appropriate communication skills. On the other hand, acts of Nonverbal Psychological Violence are more difficult to detect because they exist in an ambiguous form and are performed when the victim is not present. That is why to put an end to these two types of abuse we need different skills. Usually, when we make verbal insults, we tend to go against the person's argument. If someone calls you a liar, you automatically try to convince the other person that this is all wrong. You assume that the other party is someone who can listen to your argument. But the reality is that you can't reason with a verbal abuser. The only way to stop this is, every time you are Abused, point out what the other person is doing. If someone scolds you for something unintended, first ignore the content of the words, determine what form of abuse this is, and then calmly ask the abuser to stop the behavior immediately. (Evans, 2009) For example, a friend blamed her friend for a late departure and now both of them are stuck in traffic. Instead of trying to convince the other person that you didn't anticipate this unexpected turn of events, use an affirmative tone of voice to say, ""Don't blame yourself for things beyond your control. Go away. ."" Or if someone keeps calling you a liar, an idiot, don't try to convince them that you're not. Instead, say bluntly, “Stop labeling yourself with negative labels” or “Stop naming yourself like that.” If the above treatment doesn't work, the only thing you can do is to leave the place. For example, if someone still screams at you despite your best efforts to stay calm, leave the room. The abuser's goal is for you to resist, whether verbally, emotionally, or physically. Now, instead of trying to reason with them, point out that their actions are completely wrong and that you will not accept these behaviors. Some Abuse will gradually learn to change their behavior through being pointed out, others will not. If you often experience verbal violence from family members, lovers, friends, colleagues, it is time to reconsider this relationship to end it. Ending a relationship with an abuser is not easy, especially when you have to rely on that person, two people with young children, or someone who has a profound influence on your social relationships. In these cases, the only way to limit abuse is to minimize contact with the partner, only talking to each other when both are in public or between non-violent people. .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If a man really wants to know more about you, he will definitely invite you. If he's still not dating you, he may need a little more time to confirm his feelings. Give him a few more weeks and you'll know the answer. Don't worry too much about why he hasn't asked you out yet, just be yourself and take care of yourself. When you're getting to know someone, you don't necessarily give up the opportunity to get to know someone else. Waiting forever for a guy is not a good idea.

However, no matter how open she is, the girl's extroverted mentality still has recognizable weaknesses in love. It is often seen that guys have to be the first to initiate a conversation, actively pursue the girl they like, even the one who has to lower their self-esteem a bit to spoil their girl no matter what the reason. What. Men are passionate about conquering. When they like someone, instinctively, they will not hesitate to show affection. Whether they really like you or not, they have to achieve their goal of taking down the female prey first. Therefore, boys ""like"" girls who are somewhat passive and create conditions for them to satisfy their ego as much as possible. Because the above truth has existed for a long time as a theorem that does not need to be proven, it is also true for a long time, so the psychology of an extrovert girl, no matter how active, will be a weakness. Maybe the initiative of the extrovert girl will promote well in the field of work, making friends, but in love, it is still quite risky. Why? Extroverted girls are very strong, can compete with men in many fields, even more confident than other girls, are role models for both men and women, inevitably at times of weakness. heart when giving your heart to someone. And in love, whoever shows affection first will lose. Of course, girls need to be respected, and boys always have an inherent conquering nature. There's nothing wrong with the two complementing each other. An extrovert girl's mentality will love to prove that she can do anything, and is more likely to display possessive and conquest than her boyfriend's. But hold back a bit because if the hunt is full of hunters, they will all go home empty-handed. Of course, you don't always have to pretend to be passive. You are an extroverted girl, you have the right to express yourself to be true to yourself, it doesn't hurt to pretend to be someone else and one day the needle in the bag will come out. Believe that not all guys are the same, maybe the ingenious, subtle and reasonable initiative will help you score points in the emotional field, which is weaker for extroverted girls! The second psychological weakness of extroverted girls is financial independence. The more extroverted they are, the more interested they are in aspects of gender equality. This independence is both positive and negative. It shows that a girlfriend is someone who is able to take care of herself, but also makes guys shy. In fact, this financially independent aspect of the extroverted modern woman is highly valued by educated and intelligent men. They admire girls with stable careers, girls who take care of themselves and know what they need. It shows logical thinking, professional foresight and affirms its position in society. However, emotionally, if this strength is not properly expressed, it will inadvertently make the boys no longer interested and want to end the relationship. The girl's personality is extroverted, moreover, financially independent but a bit too dependent, constantly paying when dating or using one to show that she is better than the other will make them feel uncomfortable. contempt and selfishness. On the one hand, extroverted women are admired by men for their sociability and independence that few women have. On the other hand, because of this trait, very few women submit or spend blindly. It may appeal to men at first, but then they will fear for the ""behind-the-scenes"" place in their relationship. In addition, extroverted women in the @ era have a higher judgment than the average person, because they have more exposure conditions and certain comparisons. Being too demanding of herself is also an obstacle in love if it persists in the psyche of an extroverted girl. Everyone has the right to claim legitimate rights, be conquered and want to become ""valuable"", but girls beware of these seemingly strong weaknesses that will make the love line unfavorable. !",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4.0,leading scholar of the school of behavioral psychology,lead scholar school behavior psycholog,"The early programs of classical behavioral psychology, according to Watson, included: 1. The behavioral psychology school held that it was not concerned with describing or explaining psychological states of consciousness but Only interested in the behavior of human existence, the object of behavioral psychology is human behavior. Accordingly, behavior is considered as a synthesis of the body's responses to stimuli of the external environment. 2. According to Watson, there are four types of behavior: external behavior, internal behavior, explicit automatic behavior and latent automatic behavior. Everything a person does, including thinking, falls into one of these four types of behavior. 3. In classical behavioral psychology, animal and human behavior is referred to body movements. Thanks to these movements, a ""reactive organ"" or a ""material system"" adapts to the environment to ensure its existence. The observation as well as the explanation of behavior must follow the formula S – R. In which S is the stimulus, R is the response. The stimulus can be the general condition of the environment or some internal condition of the organism, the response is whatever the organism does and it includes many things. 4. With the formula S–R, Watson has proposed a behavioral theory with a noble purpose that is to control the behavior of animals and humans. He took the principle of ""trial and error"" as the starting point to control behavior. Watson also argues that psychology as the science of behavior is responsible for discarding all terms of structural and functional psychology such as consciousness, states, and processes. By taking behavior as a research object and using natural scientific methods, psychology initially had the appearance of objective psychology. As Watson's classical school of behavioral psychology began to show signs of being obsolete, delegates developed new behavioral theories, notably updated E. Tolman (1886-1959). This class takes it to another level. The new behavioral theory suggests that, in the traditional SR formulation, new behaviorists add mediating variables as an indirect link to stimuli and responses. The most prominent include Tolman's theory. According to him, behavioral theory has many names at once: holistic behavior theory, intentional behavior theory and fabricated behavior theory. Tolman's theory is a mixture of behavioral theory, Ghetani, fabrication theory, and intention theory. Thinking that bodily behavior is the sum total of bodily responses rather than individual bodily responses, Tolman formulated the theory of ""mediator variables"" as a mediator of SR map. In this doctrine is included the whole essence of objective psychology and behaviorism. He proposed two types of variables to determine behavior: distal or primitive variables, which include external stimuli into the initial physiological state, and permanent variables, which include mediating and intervening variables. According to him, the movement of behavior must always rely on ""objective fulcrums"", ie must be considered in the direct causal relationship ""independent parameter - dependent parameter"". This is reflected in the behavior diagram produced by animals from the perspective of choice: Independent parameter - intermediate parameter - dependent parameter - Skinner behavior is the most representative of one of the trends. direction. position of radical behavioral theory. The famous box experiment made him ""realize"" the concept of man and human and social behavior. Thus, Skinner's theory has become an integral part of the modern school of behavioral psychology. In his theory, Skinner's most important contribution was behavioral technology. He created a type of process called ""behavioral engineering,"" or the final step in human behavior. The process of behavioral technology is determined by human life and society. This is a correct argument. According to Skinner's theory, behavioral technology is: a. The notion that man is first and foremost an individual organism or a physical system in the sense that a complex system behaves in a certain way; b. The central tool is the artifact concept; c. Functional analysis is the construction and operation method of behavioral technology. The scheme of this principle is still the SR; d. The mechanism of all human behavioral engineering processes is in the control mode of reinforcement; D. Ethically, behavioral technology is neutral, i.e. the whole essence of all observable human activities lies in reinforcement; f. In behavioral technology there are six types of control: economic, educational, moral, state, religious and psychotherapeutic. Today, the school of behavioral psychology remains one of the pillars of modern psychology, contributing to the explanation of many psychological problems, although many views are outdated. The contributions of eminent scholars have also made this school more popular and comprehensive than ever.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Depression is a disorder that affects mood, causing a constant feeling of sadness and loss of interest. It often negatively affects the way you feel, think, and behave, along with a host of other emotional and physical problems. Patients may have difficulty performing daily activities and sometimes they feel that life is not worth living. More than just mood swings for a few hours, depression doesn't break out easily. Treating this disease takes a lot of time and effort. Most people will feel better with medication and psychotherapy. Depression is no exception. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), depression kills an average of 850,000 people each year, by 2020 depression is the second leading cause of death. Manifestations of this disease are different for each person and it is not easy to know if this person is depressed or not, sometimes the patient also doubts himself. To test this, psychotherapist Sarah Schuster wrote on Facebook asking: ""When you are depressed, how do the people around you react?"" And here are some of the answers: It's really frustrating, for hours on end. Then the thought of telling me to take a shower to clear my mind made me feel tired. At times like these, I'd rather take a nap. No one understood, but the anxiety mixed with boredom made me exhausted like I was fighting a real fight with a professional boxer. I don't like making gossip calls for hours. I prefer texting. Less pressure. It's also a way to avoid noise. It's not that I don't like being around people, but it's because I'm pretty sure people can't stand it when I'm around. Sometimes I spend all day cramming food into my stomach. I can feel my stomach rumbling but I have no intention of getting up and doing something to eat. I used to live with depression. People don't seem to realize it because I always smile and talk normally when communicating with them, even, I often tell jokes and make them laugh. They think I am a cheerful person, but inside I am a dark color, full of sadness and despair. On vacations, I always try to work to avoid spending time with my family. I always feel pressured to talk about my future and life with them. Depression makes me feel like there's a bad person inside of me. That demon always tells me that I have no joy, no hobbies, no energy, no appetite, no feeling bright. Like something is gnawing at my own soul. Unless you've been through that, you won't be able to understand how I feel. I really don't want anyone to go through that bad feeling. For me, depression makes me lazy. I don't want to stay in touch with other people, I don't take good care of myself, and I react negatively to normal things. Neglecting simple things like doing laundry, not wanting to cook or just eating. People around me think I'm lazy. Every day, I struggle not to give up and try to make myself feel like a valuable person. When I say I'm depressed, then I want someone to be around and say it's not just me, it's not that I want attention. I just sit all day. It was only when I used the bathroom that I really woke up. The chair is also my bed. I have my own bed but I only use one chair. I didn't sleep well and ate very little. TV is on, I can watch or not watch. I just sit like that. I buried my head in work. I work as a receptionist at a fitness center, so I have to be smiling and happy all the time. As soon as I opened the door to enter the house, I really felt like I was about to ""collapse"". Overwrought! At night, I just want to curl up in a corner and worry constantly. People who have come into contact with me will never think that I am struggling with illness every day. But I'm a non-disclosure professional. I don't talk much in crowded places, especially people I just met for the first time. I feel a little scared. I'm afraid people don't like me, I might break their atmosphere, or they think I'm a bit silly or crazy… Try to drink a lot. Maybe someone thinks I'm always trying to be an indispensable character in parties or drinking parties. But no, when I'm drunk, I feel better. I cut ties with the people I care about because I can't stand being hurt by them! People just think I'm selfish and crazy. Every morning when I wake up, I feel like a failure. I have to tell myself every morning that I'm doing my job well, my kids love me, my husband needs me… and if I don't go to work, everything will stop working… like I'm paralyzed… Hold the throne My home's darkness is a consolation for me. People always tell me: “Letting light into the house relieves boredom”. Darkness is a part of my living space that makes me feel comfortable, not alone, during my worst days. Every night I look at all the remains of dead relatives I have and wish they would drag me along. I don't want to do this anymore. I am 71 years old and have been depressed since I was 18. It's worth noting that there's currently no surefire way to prevent depression, but the following measures may help:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Women who talk a lot are not necessarily lazy women. Silent women are also not sure how to behave. It is important that you know when to talk a lot and when to be quiet. Men should not be afraid to listen to their woman but at the right time, in the right place. Wise women do not take men's words lightly. I have to let every time I speak, my husband wants to hear. Don't let the words come in, your husband is bored with other things. Wise women are always careful and skillful in communicating with their husbands. Soft at the right time, hard at the right place, men also respect and love more. Men should not be afraid to listen to their woman but at the right time, in the right place. A wise woman does not control all her husband's private space. Where the husband goes, the wife does not care but must return on time. Whatever the husband does, the wife should not be close, but if it is not good, do not blame it. A wise wife does not care about everything in her husband, but the husband always knows when to stop. The wife is as smart as indifferent, but knows everything. A wise wife always lets her husband know that family is not an option, and that betrayal will only end in cost.

1.0,causes of depression that not everyone knows.,caus depress know,"New experts find a common ground among depressed people. It is possible that we are about to have a medical breakthrough. Depression is one of the very serious diseases that people in modern society are facing. It can make people sink into melancholy, always filled with negative thoughts, which in the long run will increase the risk of suicide. Why do people get depressed? There are many causes, and most are due to pressure in life. However, a new study has pointed to some common ground among people with depression, and it could be a major turning point for the world of medicine. Accordingly, in people with depression, blood levels of a molecule called acetyl-L-carnitine are very low. Among them, cases of major depression accounted for the lowest rate. Acetyl-L-carnitine is a substance produced naturally by the body that is responsible for breaking down fat molecules and creating energy. But with this study, acetyl-L-carnitine also seems to be linked to depression. In fact, in recent years, a lot of evidence has pointed to this connection. In 1991, scientists confirmed that acetyl-L-carnitine supplementation had the potential to treat depression – especially in older adults. Or a 2016 Rockefeller University study on rats also confirmed the antidepressant powers of acetyl-L-carnitine. And even, its effects only last for a few days, instead of a few weeks like today's popular depression drugs. Brains of people with depression (left) and people without depression (right). And it was Carla Nasca - the author of that study - and colleagues who went on to conduct further human trials. ""As a psychologist, I have treated many patients with depression,"" said Natalie Rasgon of Stanford University, one of the experts who carried out the study. “Depression is the leading cause of reduced productivity at work and the leading cause of suicide decisions. More importantly, current treatments for depression are only 50% effective, with terrifying long-term side effects.” To prove it, the team tested 71 depressed patients between the ages of 20 and 70. The patients would have to fill out a survey, undergo several tests and have blood tests. Of the 71 people, 43 had major depression at the time of the study. As a result, when compared, the experts found that their blood levels of acetyl-L-carnitine were very low. In particular, people with the most severe depression also had the lowest concentrations. Notably, these are people who are either resistant to conventional antidepressants, or are depressed because of past events such as violence, violence, poverty, etc. This group accounts for 25% - 30% of the total. cases of depression, and even those most in need of help. According to Rasgon and Nasca, acetyl-L-carnitine can actually be a lifesaver. However, many more steps are needed before this supplement can be used as a full-fledged treatment. Simply because its effectiveness has been proven in mice. Furthermore, experts do not know why this association exists. Research in mice shows that acetyl-L-carnitine can act on the brain, blocking over-stimulated nerve impulses. But with that said, this conclusion needs more evidence. However, this is still considered a breakthrough. “We have found a new drug that has the potential to treat depression,” says Rasgon. “We also haven't tested whether acetyl-L-carnitine supplementation actually helps patients get out of depression. Dosage, frequency and duration of action? There are many questions that need to be answered.” The study was published in the scientific journal PNAS.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2.0,20 things to remember when you live with someone with depression,thing rememb live depress,"In a recent talk on Tedx, psychiatrist and philosopher Neel Burton explained that depression can represent an enduring search for meaning and value in life. A person with depression can be thought of as someone who is working to create meaning in life, trying to achieve more, fix more, and improve more. Furthermore, depression can also be a way to prepare for a better, healthier future for ourselves and those around us. Professor Burton went on to mention the most influential and inspiring people to ever face that illness such as Abraham Lincoln and Winston Churchill. They searched for peace and happiness only to get lost in the depths of melancholy, but in the end they changed the course of history. See also: 8 Signs That You're ""Extremely Sensitive"" It takes great will and honesty to admit the presence of depression, but it also pushes people to find answers. in the darkest moments of life. As a result, depression can lead people into the deep forest of the soul, helping to clear the thorns and weeds that are covering the beauty of life. It's not about fear, cowardice or indifference. I believe one of the most common assumptions about people with depression is that they want to be left alone. While that may seem true at times, if a friend, relative, or neighbor visits, it can be a powerful spiritual remedy. According to a theory that is still being researched, the root of depression is a lack of social relationships in the community, including within the family. Overwork, television and technology make everyday communications seem artificial and disconnected. People with depression need more companions, more friends, more greetings, and more people willing to spend time with them than leave them alone. The next time you think about someone going through depression, instead of choosing to avoid them, think about doing something nice, connecting, and friendly with them. Jesus is an example, He is always with everyone. More specifically, he chooses to be with trustworthy people so that he doesn't feel lonely. In fact, Satan chose the right time when He was alone to tempt Him in the most favorable way. Take care of loved ones or friends with depression who need you more than ever. I now recall when I was a child, my mother always emphasized the importance of relying on her siblings during lonely and difficult times. Family and community are natural remedies for depression. Take advantage of that more often. Mother Teresa made it clear that “The worst need is loneliness and the feeling of being unloved.” Only people with depression understand how difficult it is to hide their true feelings and thoughts so as not to feel ashamed. They are characterized by being very aware of themselves and their thoughts, feelings, and how people treat them. The effects of depression are big enough to bury them all day long – they don't have time to care what the people around them do. Unfortunately, people with depression often isolate themselves because they don't want to negatively affect anyone. Although not always, people with depression want to be able to keep their illness under control so as not to embarrass people. This can be a paradox because being alone can actually make symptoms worse. Depression makes people feel like a burden to society and those around them. They do not want to attract attention, do not want to be pampered or see life through rose-tinted glasses. They understand that managing depression is their most important life goal so as not to become a burden or hurt others. If they accidentally hurt or offended you, remember that it's not their fault, it's depression. Tell your loved one that you completely accept them, unconditionally, and remind them of the qualities you hold dear in them. The human body is a complex machine. It is the oldest living organism on Earth that we still do not know how to keep it from being destroyed. The human brain and its many other structures and functions are even more complex. Although the causes of some depressions are not fully understood, many of us still consider people with depression to be disabled, even disabled. Personality has nothing to do with being diagnosed with depression. Just like having a double chin, being overweight or having a lisp, depression is a human trait, with no specific cause, depression can occur in a person's life for a variety of reasons. And that is not a sign of a disabled or disabled person. The most helpful thing you can do is to continue to appreciate them, to continue to regard them as normal, strong, and precious people. People living with depression have many questions and ideas about their life, happiness and meaning on this Earth. It's not just about making money or being successful in your career. It's not just about living the ""American dream"". It's not as simple as living in the present moment and hoping everything will work out. Strangely, depression makes your worldview more open and inclusive. People with depression want the world to be a better and fairer place. They want answers to every challenge in life and then share their knowledge with as many people as possible. Many times, that curiosity can backfire because it only prompts more questions than answers. So, in essence, people with depression are intelligent, inquisitive, inquisitive, and creative. And that's an advantage, not a disadvantage. In the biggest battle of their lives, depressed patients need encouragement, not bullies. In the darkest of times, friends can be angels and angels can be saviors. At some point in your life, you will be given the choice to become a savior or, conversely, a life saver. Be a savior. Give them the gift of your acceptance, help, encouragement, and presence. What is the opposite of depression? Is mania! (Mania: high mood or unusual excitability) Science has proven that laughter is beneficial for the soul and mind. The same is true for people with depression. I always remember the episode of Jerry Seinfeld, in which Jerry had a sick friend in the hospital and Jerry tried to make him laugh. But, he ended up killing his friend because he made you laugh too much. But don't worry, you won't hurt your loved ones and friends with joy and laughter. Just make them laugh more. People with depression care a lot. They care about what you think, how you see them, how you see yourself, and what people need. Maybe they care too much. The most caring people I have ever met are people with some form of depression. Let them know what you need and don't need. Create boundaries that are respectful, clear, and meaningful to them. Also, ask what they want and need and let them know what you can offer. There is nothing more than a good relationship based on healthy communication and reasonable boundaries. Facing depression means enduring discrimination. And of course, it's not the person with depression that makes the difference, it's the society. I don't know how many times I have to say that stopping discrimination will help ease the social effects of depression. Respect means a value, not an action. If it's action, I'd rather pay to buy it than hope not to get it. Respect means seeing them for who they really are, not just depression. Depression has the ability to mask the positive aspects and outstanding qualities of the sufferer. Don't let illness fool you and your loved ones. Look for and celebrate the best you've never seen in people suffering from this horrible disease. Deal with them without being overly cautious. Just do your thing and assume that the depressed person is perfectly healthy. Simply living a routine, but a purposeful and predictable routine can sometimes bring unexpected advances, even as a cure for depression. Everyone has their own talent, just like everyone has their own breath. Of course, people with depression have their own abilities too. On the other hand, they can also do well. If you don't know what they can do, your next task is to find it. Help them find their true passion. Find ways to nurture, develop and maintain that passion for the long term and gradually remove any negative signs that the fight against depression brings. ""Everyone on Earth has the capacity to give and receive love. People with depression are no exception. Give so you can receive. Treat people the way you want them to be treated. Yes, there may be many rules in life, but the fact that they are dealing with depression doesn't change their ability to love or feel. Give them love, give them love. Love comes to you. You will find love more abundant than you can imagine. Mixed in moments of coping with symptoms of depression with joy, laughter and empathy. If you are waiting for those moments to appear, you think that, actually, even if your favorite movie is not all great, you just have to wait for the parts you like the most. In the search for ways to alleviate depression, sufferers become natural problem solvers. So don't be surprised if they turn out to be inquisitive or avid readers. Don't be surprised if they ask questions that can't be answered right away. Many of the world's pioneering leaders are guided by deep analysis, thoughtful thinking, and unwavering beliefs and values. This is really a refreshing realization! Boredom is not incompetence but hidden talent. No one can answer all of life's questions, nor solve all of the problems of inequality. Sometimes just let the questions come up, that's all. The fight against depression can last a lifetime, or just a moment. Either way, there must be a winner. The question is: when will the disease go away and how can it heal faster? The goal is to conquer the disease, not give up and live in self-pity. Most importantly, it's important to remember that depression is treatable and there's a lot of support available to those who want to fight it. One of the first things to do is accept the presence of the disease. Once you accept it, you can begin to heal. People who do not accept the fact that they have a disease often try to hide it or try to solve the problem on their own. Like a silent mist enveloping the grasslands, gradually obscuring your view along the way, depression can quietly approach its victims. Mood is unstable, easy to change. It's not something that can be easily controlled with a switch or a lever. Like a dewdrop, can you dispel it? Maybe not. The person you love is trying their best to be happy, have fun, and connect with people, and what they need is simple. They just need you to be with them. So on. It's as simple as sitting together reading a book, watching a comedy, going to a coffee shop and sipping together. Such things don't need a psychologist, just you being present and accepting them. Let the fog clear itself when the sun rises and welcome a new day. One of the symptoms of depression is fatigue and lack of energy. One of the most effective drugs in practice is exercise. You may have heard this advice before, but let me be more specific. There are different types and lengths of exercise, but to be effective, at least go for a brisk walk 3 times a week for 30 minutes. That's the amount of exercise a person needs to do to feel the antidepressant effects. This is easy to do, right? So if the sun rises and the winds are whispering to you outside, take your loved one for a walk. They may not see results immediately, but they will gradually. Practicing this method is also a way to increase your chances of overcoming depression and increase your vitality. Irritability is also a symptom of depression. While there's no excuse for treating people with disrespect, it's important to let go of your friction with someone who is depressed. On the other hand, setting even limited expectations with them is appropriate and necessary. Expectations are the minimum standards that you expect from a person, while limits can also be thought of as expectations that are set to keep a relationship harmonious. If a depressed person hurts your feelings, let them know, however, as in any relationship, you shouldn't include criticism in your comments. Simply let them know how you feel and what to expect from them. And if they're not willing to listen, try again next time you feel better. Let them know that you love them but you also love yourself. Not only do you set an example of self-love, but you also teach them communication and limit-setting skills. Like ""You should hang out with your friends more"". If there's anything like a trigger for someone to be depressed, it's ""advice"" on what to do. The habit of “advising” is already ingrained in them. If you're not sure what ""advice"" is here, it's any sentence that contains the word SHOULD. For example, “You SHOULD go out and exercise more”, “You SHOULD stop being sad”, “If I were you, I would…” “You SHOULD take my advice”. Not only does it show that you're bossy, but it also suggests that people with depression aren't self-aware of what they're supposed to do. The important thing is that it makes people feel like the speaker is their parent. And depressed people don't need their parents telling them what to do. Instead, ask them as many open-ended questions as possible. It will help them think through options, consider solutions, deepen their ideas, expand their possibilities, etc. Telling them “should or should not” only make them feel more forced and no effect. Remember, open-ended questions are not ""yes or no"" questions! This is a must. It is not true to say that family failure to help even aggravates depression is not true. In fact, many treatments for depression involve the role of family or partner. And while depression can make relationships worse, relationships can also be used as a tool to help depressed patients understand themselves and learn to regulate interactions. ""One of the best ways to change their lives is to let them know you'll always be there for them. It's not something they simply understand. It's something that needs to be said face-to-face. It's the way you are. show support and encourage them to participate in events or projects – Eliminate “should or shouldn’t” elements in your words – Respect their feelings, thoughts them and use as many open-ended questions as possible."" At Sea World amusement park, blackback dolphins are trained through incentives. In parenting, incentives have been shown to be more effective than deterrents. And in most relationships, focusing and emphasizing the positive is a good and effective way to enhance desired behavior. On the other hand, being encouraged is a great feeling. We all have worked at least once in our lives. In the workplace, if we receive praise at work, appreciated for our efforts, then surely both of us. our performance and quality of life. dedication to work will increase.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2.0,4 happiness hormones you can't ignore in life,happi hormon nt ignor life,"In your opinion, 30 minutes of exercise and 30 minutes of extended sleep in the morning, which side offers a higher marginal benefit? Most people think that staying in bed for an extra 30 minutes will make them feel happier. In fact, however, studies have shown that people who take the time to exercise in the morning feel happier. When muscle activity warms up the body, the body produces a chemical that makes people feel excited and energetic, which is much better than warming up the body. in the blanket. This is the feeling that Endorphins – one of the happy hormones brings. Besides Endorphins, what hormones will affect human happiness? In fact, there are 4 types of happiness hormones below. These include Endorphin, Dopamine, Serotonin and Oxytocin. In the following article, we will learn together in detail about these 4 hormones. Endorphin (vnexpress.net) is likened to the body's natural ""painkiller"" and stress reliever. Derived from the phrase ""endogenous morphine"" which means ""morphine in the body"", endorphins are ""modulated"" by the pituitary gland in the hypothalamus to create a feeling of relaxation, euphoria, optimism, and love of life. In addition, it also helps strengthen resistance, reduce pain, stress and slow down the aging process. Endorphins are released during exercise. They work to end pain and reduce discomfort. In the process of building happiness, this substance will help people increase physical strength and feel full of energy. The human body has up to 20 different types of endorphins, the good news is that we can completely increase this happiness hormone by: Hormone dopamine is the hormone that creates a feeling of euphoria and joy. This hormone is released when you strive for a certain goal. They push you to work harder to get to the finish line. At the same time, dopamine also helps improve mental and concentration. Dopamine brings instant joy and gratification, leaving people wanting more. Alcohol and stimulants contain cocaine, nicotine contains significant amounts of Dopamine. That's why people often turn to them when they're stressed. Dopamine is also loaded into the body when we feel fulfilled. The process of creating a desire to achieve and striving to achieve a goal increases satisfaction, which is the amount of dopamine in us. Therefore, people tend to want to achieve more, the more goals accomplished, the higher the satisfaction level. We can increase the amount of Dopamine in the body by: People call serotonin the happy hormone because it has a great impact on your happy state. Serotonin helps regulate mood and fight depression. This hormone acts as a natural sleep aid. Serotonin even plays an important role in regulating appetite and sex drive. If you feel that you are suffering from severe depression or are more emotional than usual, such as bursting into tears while watching a Korean movie, it means that your serotonin levels are quite low.

Serotonin is a chemical produced by the body that allows brain cells and other cells of the nervous system to communicate with each other. Too little serotonin in the brain may play a role in depression. However, too much serotonin can lead to excessive neural activity and cause a range of potentially fatal symptoms, also known as ""serotonin syndrome"". With serotonin syndrome, patients often present with confusion, agitation or restlessness, decreased attention, headache, changes in blood pressure and/or temperature, nausea and/or vomiting, diarrhea, and tachycardia. , muscle pain or twitching, tremors, sweating… In severe cases, serotonin syndrome can be life-threatening.

Oxytocin is the love hormone (Medicalnewstoday), making you feel more loved and trusted. Oxytocin is produced in large quantities during sex. Cuddling gestures like hugs and kisses have the same effect. This chemical is called “chemical glue” and assumes the responsibility of an adhesive. It works to maintain marital and emotional life by making men find ways to avoid attractive women. People with more oxytocin in their blood tend to be more attached to their partners. In addition, oxytocin also has a strong impact on positive human emotions such as trust, empathy and tolerance. It also helps to increase the bond between parents and children. (Psychologytoday) We can produce Oxytocin in the body by: Happiness is always sought, so there's no reason why you can't create your own joy. You can find a new hobby, do small things every day that you enjoy…. Great joy comes from simple and small joys. Do something every day to reaffirm the beauty and joy of life. Whether it's going for a walk, gardening, sitting with the kids in the park, enjoying your favorite music or just sitting and looking at the flowers in the garden, allow yourself to remember the beautiful things around us…. These absolutely help stimulate the growth of happy hormones. In addition, do regular exercise. Not only makes the body healthier, exercise also helps you release bad energy and absorb happy hormones for the body. When muscle activity will cause the body to heat up, the body will produce a chemical that makes people feel excited and full of energy. And don't forget to supplement your body with low-fat, nutrient-rich foods. Also, never force yourself into a strict diet. Because eating enough nutrition, enjoying a delicious food is also a happiness of life. The ultimate purpose of life is happiness. All human endeavors spring from the desire to achieve happiness. In fact, happiness hormone (Yan.vn) always exists in each person's body. It is Endorphin, Dopamine, Serintonin, Oxytocin waiting to be activated. When you think about the achievements to be achieved, the admiration of the crowd, and the sweet images of love, do you find your body also filled with joy, longing, and excitement? Each happiness hormone has its own way of being activated. Our task is to find a way to activate them properly and rationally so that we can experience our own sense of happiness.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4.0,ways to train your sixth sense you need to know,way train sixth sen need know,"The five basic senses include smell, sight, taste, touch, and hearing. These senses are based on physical sensations, they allow us to perceive things that exist around us. In addition, the 6th sense - besides the 5 basic senses mentioned above, can help people have more subtle feelings about life. The sixth sense is sometimes described as intuition, or the feeling of knowing something without knowing it beforehand. Next, learn how to exercise and harness your sixth sense. The sixth sense is a process that gives us the ability to understand things directly without analytical reasoning, bridging the gap between the conscious and subconscious parts of the mind and between instincts and instincts. instinct. reason, the language of everyday life or intuition tells us to act abnormally according to our inner and hunch without reason. The sixth sense, also known as intuition, or hunch, allows us to see what the other five senses cannot see in detail such as hunches, sensations, imaginations, etc., about the world. invisible world that the other five senses see only in the visible world. the world, that is, what is. It is often said that many times through intuition, people repeatedly get out of danger. According to the psychological analysis of Sigmund Freud - former Austrian neuroscientist and psychologist: when making a small decision, you should rely on your reason, list the pros and cons, and then conduct the analysis. accumulate. them and make the right decisions. When you need to make big and important decisions, you should rely on your subconscious mind, such as choosing a life partner or developing a career. Because these great decisions require the foundation of your greatest need from the depths of your soul. The so-called ""arbitrary"" is listening to your inner voice and following your intuition. The creation of the sixth sense has different areas. One is a hunch, that is, in the moment the subject suddenly grasps the way of thinking to solve the problem, but then it is still not clear enough; The second is enlightenment, which is also the perception in an instant, the subject suddenly understands the nature of things, or grasps the crux of the problem; See also: The secret behind people with schizophrenia Ba is intuition, that is, in the blink of an eye, the subject suddenly perceives the problem as a whole. First, to create intuition requires knowledge of correlation and accumulation. The so-called correlated knowledge here includes relevant empirical knowledge as well as relevant specialized theoretical knowledge. Second, in a certain situation, the subject is either in a certain situation or observing a certain phenomenon, or under a sudden pressure, or is just the subject's state of mind. temporary way. Exciting times, thinking give birth to breakthroughs, intuition emerges. What intuitive thinking relies on is direct feeling, not emotional perception. “Follow your guts” that people often say, except for the expression, the rest is the intuitive element. Intuition requires you to carefully experience, understand, and listen to the information and calling from it. See also: Cryptomnesia syndrome- The scariest dementia you need to know. When intuition arises, you should not hesitate, much less suppress it. You should ""follow the water pushing the boat"" and make timely judgments and decisions. Focus on your breathing or walking. This dedicated training can enhance one's inner awareness, understand one's thoughts, discover inner thoughts and strength. Intuition is based on your own knowledge and experience, but it is often influenced by objective circumstances and personal emotional distractions. Especially later, when a person falls into a vicious cycle of doubt, resentment, and resentment in love, intuitive judgment can lose its objectivity. Therefore, in the process of generating intuition, you should try to eliminate all these influences and disturbances. After intuition appears, you should re-analyze your objectivity before making a decision. The sudden feature of intuition is its ability to observe and gain insight. Observation and intuition and opinion are all correlated. People with sharp observation ability, the higher the frequency of intuition, the stronger the effect of seeing the nature of things. Therefore, you should consciously train your quickness in observation, especially in observing invisible things like impressions, feelings, trends or moods, etc. It appears based on knowledge. and human experience. Therefore, intuition often ""favors"" people with extensive knowledge and rich experience. No one denies the necessity of technological devices in today's digital age. However, as women increase their ""connection"" with devices, women are somewhat reducing their ""connection"" with themselves. Have the courage to put your phone down when it's not absolutely necessary. On weekends, instead of holding your laptop to watch movies or surf the web, you should go out for a walk or cook with close friends. At first, it will be difficult to “wean” electronic devices. However, experts advise you to control the time using them instead of giving up immediately. For example, if you spend eight hours a day sitting in front of a computer screen at work, you won't use it when you get home if you don't need it. Or spend an hour or two surfing the web every day, then spend time reading or journaling. To ensure health, you should stay away from electronic devices as well as turn off the network to limit radiation that can adversely affect the brain. Instead of relying on assistive devices, you should let your intuition tell you what to do. Over time, your judgment will become sharper. There will be times when you lament ""why her sixth sense is so sharp, why can't I be like them"", but you forget that you also own the ""master key"". It's just that you don't know how to take advantage of it, or are covered by surrounding factors. No matter how busy you are, try to make time to ""listen"" to yourself. Make it a habit to write or photograph moments that impress you and you'll see yourself through them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The self-abortion effect is a phenomenon that occurs in the female of pregnant mammals, when exposed to the smell of an unfamiliar male, they will self-abort. During pregnancy, the scent of a female coming into contact with an unfamiliar male causes the female to abort herself. This effect was discovered by Hida Bruce in 1959 after studying mammals, specifically here, rats. The British scientist first observed this phenomenon in caged mammals: hamsters, lions and Gelada monkeys. Scientist Hida Bruce has specifically commented on pregnant lab rats that miscarried in the presence of a new male. These were again confirmed in wild baboons in the Simien Mountains National Park in Ethiopia, carried out by research scientist Eila Roberts. In addition, a team of scientists led by Beohner discovered the Bruce effect in wild African baboons. Studies have shown that women end up having abortions themselves. Experimental analysis performed on fetal samples showed that many women had abortions from early pregnancy. This happens at a high rate in the group of strong men. For shorter males, the ratio is higher. And after changing the leader, in the first 2 weeks, the rate of female monkeys having miscarriage increased, this was done by the male monkey. Children born during this period were all killed by the new leader because these children carried the blood of the old chief monkey. As for women, they are aware of the loss of a child, but this will save them time and effort to get pregnant and quickly get pregnant later. After analyzing the experimental results.

2.0,how is “reality” different from “reality”?,realiti differ realiti,"Once, an American friend who taught with me said to me: “You Vietnamese people always say that we Americans are pragmatic. We don't live pragmatically, we live realistically. I have been in Vietnam for more than ten years and I see that Vietnamese people live a pragmatic life.” Slightly hot, I asked again: ""So what do you define as pragmatic, what is pragmatism?"". Real life is about understanding your true abilities and values so that you can make the best use of your abilities. To be pragmatic is to defy reality. In fact, regardless of one's real ability, but only concerned with achieving small immediate benefits, in addition, regardless of how serious the consequences later. In the US, students study just enough, don't cram, don't care about achievements and don't have the concept of choosing a school, for them, a degree is just a certificate that they have met the requirements in terms of knowledge and expertise in school. to a certain extent, nothing terrible.What they care about is his ability and knowledge commensurate with his qualifications and position in society.In Vietnam, degrees and Achievement is a measure of status as well as income. Parents force their children to study fiercely to live and die in order to enter a specialized school of their choice and then go to university. After graduating from college, he had to try to swim for a master's degree. All not because of knowledge but only because of position in society. As a result, it doesn't matter what you learn, it doesn't matter if you use it, even a fake degree doesn't matter. The most important thing is to make a lot of money. In the US, every time a building is built, people have to calculate that the nature there is least affected, the ecological balance is least damaged, is the living environment of humans and animals. . artifacts are not destroyed, because they understand that natural resources are invaluable heritage that need to be preserved for future generations. In Vietnam, people just need to earn a little pocket money, people are willing to release poison into the sea, suck sand from rivers, clear forests to build hydroelectric plants, even leveling a unique ecological reserve to build a resort. , attach the cable car despite the consequences later. In America, people care about elections and politics because they know they have citizenship and that every political decision they make has a direct impact on their family's quality of life. In Vietnam, people only worry about making money to support themselves every day and every hour. They are indifferent to the negative injustices of society as long as it does not happen to them. Corruption is rampant, public debt is increasing rapidly, state-owned enterprises are losing trillions of dollars… for them, even drinking beer tomorrow will not be a problem. In America, people show patriotism by aligning their personal interests with the common good and prosperity of the nation. They do not do things that benefit themselves but go against the interests of the community. In Vietnam, people show patriotism by sitting proudly boasting about their nation's history with ancestral feats, or going crazy over a regional soccer tournament or going online without saying a word. curse a certain Westerner who dared to speak ill of Vietnam. The rest they casually use all kinds of malicious tricks to kill their fellow citizens and profit from spreading nails on the street to injecting toxic chemicals into their food. In America, people balance their lives with their religious beliefs. They go to church to find retreat and community activities to help people of the same faith. In Vietnam, people go to pagodas, temples and shrines to pray for wealth, to win the lottery, to pass exams, to seek power... as if the gods would satisfy their bottomless greed for flowers and cheap meat. of mortals. In the US, weddings, funerals, and anniversaries are private events. They keep it simple and formal and invite only people who really mean something to them. In Vietnam, funerals and funerals are a good opportunity to make an expensive publicity, both to prove to the world and to earn a lot of money. In the US, children are taught how to be independent, how to communicate, how to protect themselves from being violated, how to escape… practical skills that people need to survive and thrive in society. In Vietnam, children are crammed with sublime but useless knowledge with the goal of a degree. In the United States, human intelligence and ability are measured by creativity, invention, and contribution to society. It doesn't matter who you are, as long as you contribute to society, you will be recognized and rewarded. In Vietnam, a person's ability is assessed through his background, intelligence and ability to use tricks to advance. Contribution is a distant thing. The pragmatic lifestyle and the pragmatic lifestyle are not the same, although it is easy to confuse. A pragmatic lifestyle brings sustainable and lasting prosperity because it is built on a solid foundation of true values. On the contrary, the pragmatic lifestyle destroys and reverses practical values to create small immediate benefits, leaving incalculable harms.

The same is true of marriage, when men make mistakes, they will continue to run, if they have a boyfriend, they will leave with their lover, frankly receiving a ticket is not too controversial. And when women make mistakes, they will jump on the brakes of life and continue to find all sorts of reasons. Some people say that for the sake of their children, for the family, for their husbands, others think that it is the nature of women, so if you flirt with someone and go in a different direction, it's the man's fault, isn't it? right? not from any third party. There are many scenarios for breakups between men and women. But once the bond of sex - sex - money is not strong enough to hold the two together, they have to part because of the final punch: unsatisfied with each other. And so, after breaking up, what do they need to maintain the other's image. Can speak badly, can participate in reality TV shows to denounce ex-spouse/ex-husband. In Vietnam, I often have artists bring ex-wife and ex-husband of ex-wife to the press to break heads with each other. Self-respecting people must have been silent until much later. Not because they don't know pain and loss. I have an old friend, the two broke up amicably and at one point they were still happy. Just because they know, the next life will not be happy anymore, not compatible anymore, the purpose of marriage begins to be different, so it is better to break up sooner. And their pain is not because of the breakup but because they have to try to find some excuse to explain to their colleagues and people. And the wife - about to become ex-wife - told her husband - about to become ex-husband - that: Or we pretend to fight, curse each other loudly, chase each other in the alley, then Late at night pretend to be drunk, then I still divorce Kiss properly? Or pretend to have an affair and then get jealous? In the end, the couple gave up because they couldn't do anything against their self-respect and kindness. They could not find an excuse to explain to the world their amicable parting. They became the bait of the market for a long time. After all, for better or worse, men and women break up, leaving a void in their lives. It's a space where they bond together, make love together, fall in love, spend money together, and argue together.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most of the experiments involved their perception. Subjects were tested for cognitive, expressive, and humorous logic. The results show disparities among these people. People who overestimate themselves have very low results compared to the actual situation. People who underestimate themselves have higher results. The Dunning-Kruger (Dunning-Kruger) effect is a perceptual distortion. Incompetent people often lead to the wrong things and it is their own incompetence that prevents this perception. People who are exposed to a new field for the first time, inexperience often make wrong judgments. Also, a lack of knowledge in an area where you jump to conclusions is also a sign that you have fallen into the Dunning-Kruger effect. It is very difficult not to fall into the ""Dunning - Kruger Effect"". If you're trying to think you're not smart or think you're smart about something, reach out to the people around you. From the comments that will give you a better view. Objectivity always yields a proactive outcome. Gaining the necessary experience and knowledge is also a way for you not to get caught up in this effect. We've all probably had this problem at one point or another. Openness, listening, learning will help you develop in the best direction, not Dunning - Kruger.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1.0,obsessive-compulsive disorder (ocd),obsessivecompuls disord ocd,"What is Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD)? A disease that has been studied by researchers for many years, compulsive disorder (OCD) is an illness that disturbs the patient's mental state and distorts the patient's thinking and behavior. The patient will have unwanted fears in mind, these fears will appear continuously, causing repetitive compulsive actions. The more the patient wants to release these thoughts, the more stressed they become. And in the end, the patient ends up being unable to release his stress. Depending on the classification, compulsive disorders are also divided into different types. The occurrence of obsessions and compulsions that are not caused by drugs is obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). With this disease, the most common symptoms are: – A lot of unwanted images appear in your head, especially violent ones. Feelings of fear of harming others or doing something wrong or of shame. Worrying too much about the body's waste and dirty bacteria around, worrying about serious illness is not reasonable. Besides the above signs, there are also some compulsive behaviors such as waking up many times in the night even though the door is locked or washing hands constantly for fear of infection. When this disease is detected, the patient should immediately go to the medical facilities to be examined and treated by a doctor. Your doctor may prescribe or use medication to control the initial compulsions. Often, the treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is to find the subconscious habits that cause it. Measures and exercises can then be used to avoid those behaviors and get out of the patient's mind. This disease is completely curable if prescribed by the doctor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2.0,between boundless love is deep sadness,boundless love deep sad,"*Article by Alissa Ambrose, vice president of multimedia creation at StatNews in the US. Just a few weeks after one of the happiest days of my life, it's hard for me to accept the fact that mental illness is quietly taking over my body. Before that, I told myself I was just too tired and exaggerating the symptoms. Come to think of it, many other women feel much worse. That's how I reassured myself, but even when it worked, my mind was still pierced by moments of unbelievably sad. I love my baby more than words can describe. But I have postpartum depression and anxiety disorder. Depression engulfed me before I returned to happiness. It's hard to cope with those realities. For those with postpartum depression, anxiety is always a companion. There are certain times of the day when anxiety strikes. For example, I'm often haunted by the thought that I don't have enough milk for my baby, when I go into the ""moms"" room at the office to pump, and even when I'm composing work emails. On my daily commute, I recall the time when my 9-month-old son accompanied me on this very train. And now, the feeling of being childless in me is like having a part of my body amputated, that part of my body is only reconnected every night when I return home. But at night, watching the baby sleep in the crib next to me, my mind kept spinning and I couldn't sleep. These feelings are shared by me on an online group for mothers. Within hours, I received more than 20 responses. A stranger wrote it as “high functioning depression,” the first term I heard. One mental health expert on the team writes that she regularly sees her patients disregard the reality of the condition they're experiencing and endure - saying it's a symptom in itself. Others also shared that they had a conflict similar to what I was feeling – the conflict between being a loving mother and being lost in your own destiny. In the end, my friends told me about their similar feelings. From all that experience, I realized another truth: Postpartum depression is quite common and many mothers are afraid to talk about it. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), depression and anxiety disorders affect about 15% of postpartum women. Common symptoms include depressed mood, trouble sleeping or sleeping too much, guilt, low self-esteem, and even self-harm. Many factors that affect postpartum women can increase the risk of depression including: physical exhaustion, stress in life and lack of support from family and society. To be honest, my personal health history places me in the high-risk category and the midwives at the hospital had to monitor me very closely both before and after the birth. I took the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale test twice, but there were no signs of depression. (The Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale includes 10 questions about feelings of sadness, anxiety, panic and fear, as well as asking if they cry, have trouble sleeping or have thoughts of doing it themselves.) at screening, individuals with scores equal to or higher than 10 (on a scale of 30) are considered at risk for depression, scores equal to or greater than 13 are generally considered at risk for major depression). The third time, I took the test again when almost 4 months after giving birth, it was fate that could not be avoided, the results changed. The vague fatigue and ecstasy of motherhood gave way to constant anxiety and depression. I feel like I'm nervous all the time. And there were times when every night I had to cry. Anxiety took a step further to overwhelm me when I realized I had to shoulder both financial and family responsibilities; that I have a career that I don't want to ruin; And another simple thing is that many times I miss my baby - a child that I love so much and feel very lucky to have. Sometimes I feel like I have a few more people living in my body. Recall one Saturday, my wife and I spent the morning with family and friends. We had a nice lunch and chat. But just a few hours later – I felt so exhausted that I couldn't think or do anything – I was paralyzed between two options: should I make a simple dinner now or get ready to take a shower? baby girl bath. Then out of nowhere, a thought appeared, thinking that my family would be better off without me, that I was harming my own child. Thoughts haunting until the night. It wasn't until the next morning when I woke up that I felt a bit better. Mothers with postpartum depression often don't want or don't want help. Among women who face postpartum depression, only about 15% receive treatment. I asked Dr. Lisa Hollier, dean of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, why is this number so low? She told me that one of the biggest barriers is society's lack of effective mental health services. This I understand. I made an appointment with a counselor, but it was the result of weeks of back-and-forth phone calls, having to schedule a morning off work, and finding a babysitter. It also requires willpower to get me from home to the hospital, which is a 2 hour drive away. I have many advantages over other women – such as good prenatal and postnatal care, 12 weeks of paid leave and support from family, for example. I also have the flexibility to work from home when needed. I have good health insurance. I live in a city with some of the best hospitals in the world. However, I still have to seek more help because sometimes I feel like I just can't get through. At the time of this writing, my baby is 6 months old. I've just come out of the fog on some medication, I'm well-rested and fortunately there are many daycares in the area that allow me to spend more time with my daughter. I feel lucky that these simple changes have made things better. I will soon have my first appointment with a mental health provider with whom I look forward to a long term relationship. It was the result of months of searching for a hospital that accepted my health insurance and accepted a new client. Having a baby is an experience that has both the very ordinary and the extremely shocking sides. Now is the time to know that boundless love and deepest sadness can – and often – come at the same time. Childbirth is painful, beyond the physical pain of hours and days of labor. However, many women still leave scars on their bodies and minds, as well as the worries and joys of motherhood. I pushed myself to admit my feelings and condition to friends and family, instead of hiding it. Often women will want to tell their stories and struggles. But there are still stigmas surrounding this issue – and it is shame that can silence us.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She really didn't know she was suffering from this disease until she read a series of articles about the disease. According to recent studies, Alice in Wonderland syndrome - AIWS is caused by sensitization of the brain and usually begins in the occipital lobe, the back visual area of the brain. However, in some cases, the pain can spread to the margins and apex. And it is these areas that are the brain regions that determine the size and shape of objects that cause this syndrome. According to a biological study of patients, it has been concluded that hallucinations carry some kind of visual poison and that impairment can cause symptoms such as looking at things too big, seeing things too much. much. small or looking at objects that are too far away.

5.0,spotlight effect,spotlight effect,"Spotlight effect) by Thomas Gilovich and his colleagues in 2000. Through a simple phenomenon, researchers analyzed and demonstrated this phenomenon. . In fact, this effect is very common and everyone suffers from it. When a person cares about how people see them by their appearance and appreciates that concern. To learn about today's research, Thomas Gilovich and his colleagues applied an individual approach to each research object. The audience here is students. They gave one of the students in the division a Barry Manilow T-shirt. The people wearing this shirt are estimated to be about half of the people there recognize. However, the reality is only ¼ of the total number of people. In another study, a group of people were talking. When a person makes a good statement or misrepresents an issue, immediately observe how people see him. Simply put, the spotlight effect is how people appreciate how others see them. See yourself as the navel of the universe and others to take care of you. Compared to reality, each of us is just a grain of sand in this vast world and not to the extent we think. Caring about how people think of us is good, but being overly concerned is not. Instead of going overboard with people who care about you, you should get rid of it. Instead of feeling confused when you make a mistake, watching people notice if you have a new shirt on, relax and think freely. You are exaggerating your influence on those around you. Simply put, getting out of the spotlight will make you more comfortable in front of a crowd. You can be confident in yourself, do what you want without having to think about the people around you. You will be most confident, most beautiful when you are yourself. Don't care what others think of you or be self-centered. Live comfortably to make everything easier.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5.0,the veblen effect-everybody has to face the disease,veblen effecteverybodi face diseas,"The Veblen effect, also known as conspicuous consumption theory, was developed by an economist from his experiments. This effect is named after its creator. His findings reveal the human emotional influence on consumers' product consumption. He conducts surveys on the happiness and satisfaction of individuals when purchasing valuable products. As a result, people are happier buying expensive consumables. Not only that, buying behavior is also influenced by other shoppers, especially in high-value items. According to research by economist Thorstein Veblen, items that have a stimulating effect are those of great value. After research, these goods are called Veblen goods. According to Veblen's research, the Veblen effect contributes to uncovering the cause of demand stimulus in trade. The first cause is jealousy. Those who lack the conditions often tend to like to show off to hide this. Accordingly, they choose valuable products or Veblen goods. The second reason is pride. Most people want to show their reputation by flaunting their branded products. This is one of the common consumer behaviors. It is by discovering these two fundamental reasons that brands have attracted many customers. After studying the Veblen effect, many businessmen have hit on the customer's preference to show off. Brands should apply communication and product promotion measures in line with this buying psychology. This will stimulate demand to increase significantly. Not only that, Veblen effect can be applied in consumer behavior orientation. Savvy consumers can also self-regulate their behavior so as not to get caught up in the flow of the Veblen effect. This makes wallet control more efficient. Especially for shopaholics like women.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5.0,the zeigarnik effect - causes of procrastination at work,zeigarnik effect caus procrastin work,"The research problem began to appear in 1972. When the Russian psychologist, Zeigarnik, observed a peculiar phenomenon in a restaurant in Vienna. She observed that staff here only remember the dish when it is in the process of serving. After washing the dishes, the staff left the dishes. From this strange phenomenon, she began to conduct an experiment to find out what was happening. Zeigarnik started his research with 20 missions for many people. The tasks she gave the surveyors were relatively simple, sometimes just solving trick puzzles. After completing 20 tasks for the subjects, she asked the question: Which task do you remember. As a result, all the participants remembered the tasks they didn't complete or were interrupted. What is the reason? What does this research have to do with procrastination at work? The truth is that even after the study ended, 90% continued to find answers to disruption challenges. As a result, when people start doing that old thing, they're more likely to finish it. Therefore, just starting to work, no matter how difficult it is, you will try to do it until the end. Going back to the phenomenon that Zeigarnik first observed. In fact, the waiters only noticed the dishes when they started making it. With dishes that have been served will quickly be forgotten. Thanks to Zeigarnik's research, the zeigarnik effect was discovered and effectively supported in solving psychological phenomena in life. The disease of procrastination is one of the factors that slow down the progress of work. The proposed plans did not achieve the desired effect. To thoroughly solve this problem and improve the quality of work, it is necessary to properly apply the principle of the Zeigarnik effect. Start any job anywhere. Whatever your job, start with the simplest. Only when starting to do do you have the determination to complete. So never shirk the task. Be ready to get started. This is the secret to solving any task as quickly as possible.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5.0,zajonc – simple exposure effect.,zajonc simpl exposur effect,"The effect of simple exposure appears frequently next to us without us even knowing it. This is the effect that talks about the tendency to like familiar things. Those are the people and things we come into contact with most often. The mere exposure effect – Zajonc was discovered, studied and named after psychologist Robert Zajonc (1968). Photo effects give the best overview and explanation of proximity (propinquity). Zajonc makes the point that one of the main determinants of interpersonal attraction is physical proximity. When we don't like something but have to deal with it over and over again, we begin to enjoy it more. Experiments on the Zajonc effect took place in the student papers of the University of Michigan. On the front page of the newspaper, a pop-up box-like dialog box appeared containing Turkish words like kadirga, saricik, biwonjni, etc. Only one word appeared once, the rest appeared with frequency. bigger. When the strange series of ads disappeared, the investigators sent questionnaires to the student community and asked about their impressions of the keywords. And the results show that keywords that appear with a large frequency are chosen by many students higher than those that appear only a few times. This is the simplest proof that the human psyche is influenced by the factors of proximity and repetition. The mere exposure effect is independent of known or unknown conscious experience. It also does not depend on familiarity. They just don't care about the details, don't realize they've seen them. But just know that what appears more, more impressive, choose. The mere exposure effect – Zajonc emphasizes the importance of repetition. It brings new relationships, close relationships with the people you meet most often. But in love, this is a non-romantic love theory. Because it simply does not come from the feelings and emotions of the other party. Just because they have a lot of contact with each other and meet a lot, they become a couple. Like they say 90% of people of the opposite sex who sit together in school will become lovers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5.0,(hawthorne effect) - human behavior change effect,hawthorn effect human behavior chang effect,"The Hawthorne effect is one of the psychological symptoms that many HR managers are concerned about. With a direct impact on work productivity, this is one of the psychosocial phenomena that can be applied in human resource management. The Hawthorne effect is understood as a change in the behavior of people in a group. Emerging in the late twenties and early thirties, research by the Western Electric Hawthorne plant created an entirely new way of thinking about productivity. The experiments here were originally intended to determine optimal levels of light, temperature and humidity during the assembly of parts at Western Electric. However, experimental results show different effects on labor productivity. That is the appearance of the researchers. Specifically, when there are researchers at the factory, work productivity increases markedly. The name Hawthorne has since become the name of a psychosocial effect. After the research process of scientists, the generalized problem is the change in behavior of each person when they know they are being observed and studied. Research shows that when there is any change in working conditions, labor productivity increases. However, when conditions returned to normal, labor productivity remained high. From there, the researchers realized that the real driver of productivity was their presence. When workers know they are being subtly monitored, they put in more effort. And from there, the work efficiency increased dramatically. Accordingly, scientists explain this psychological effect as follows. When employees know they are noticed, they will strive to be the best at work, thereby increasing productivity and efficiency. Another hypothesis is raised that, when working conditions are concerned, workers will express their desires through actions. So behavior change is also one of the messages employees receive. want to send to their manager. This is one of the important psychological findings, useful for life. Managers can use this effect as a management tactic. The success of a company depends a lot on the labor capacity of its employees. Therefore, grasping the principle of increasing labor productivity and applying it appropriately is one of the great victories of management. In addition, for individuals, the Hawthorne effect also helps support the process of self-study and self-improvement very effectively.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5.0,pareidolia - face illusion,pareidolia face illus,"The phenomenon of face illusion is one of the interesting phenomena of the human brain. A sign of this phenomenon is that when looking at any object such as an orange, on a wall, on a cloud, there are human faces. It only appears in human intuition at a certain time. Pareidolia is an interesting psychological phenomenon. Many people claim to have ""seen"" human faces on walls, on slices of bread, etc. Artifact faces are formed from details of completely unrelated objects. This is a quite famous phenomenon in the world, and has been studied by psychologists to answer how people can ""see"" water stains on the ceiling of a basement wall in Chicago into the image of Germany. virgin mother Mary. Trinh. Pareidolia appears in different people in different circumstances at different times. To find out what makes people able to ""see"" these faces, and how our brains work when this phenomenon occurs. Psychologists selected 20 healthy men and asked them to observe the same image in a functional magnetic resonance imaging machine. Experiments were carried out in groups for 1 week. These people will see two pictures of a man's face in turn. One of them is clear and the other is blurred. Two more letters, one still clear and one blurry. The final photo is completely black and white and has a smudge on it. They will take turns pressing the first button if they see a face or letter. And the second button if both see nothing. And then, the experimenters were shown another series of photos that had undergone the blurring effect, and they were told that in half of these images there was a man's face and letters. As a result, up to 34% of people saw faces and 38% saw letters even though the entire number of photos was blurred with no faces or letters. Thus, it can be asserted that humans tend to search and create images themselves when having to find predefined objects in a random sequence of images. Humans can see human faces or not is due to the influence, desire in the brain formed. When we expect to see something, the brain automatically searches and gathers all the available details in the environment to respond to that expectation. And of course that's just a fun illusion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5.0,the “google” effect- the dark side of social development,googl effect dark social develop,"The google effect is one of the new effects discovered by psychologists. Hearing the name, you probably already know and understand a part of this effect, right? It is a corollary of using and relying too much on google - one of the most advanced modern inventions of the world. The Google Effect – The Google Effect is a new issue in the journal Science by psychologist Betsy Sparrow and colleagues at Columbia University. Once, after looking up some news online, she turned to her husband and asked: ""What do I do without the Internet?"". This is a question she asks her husband and is also asking herself. We cannot deny that the presence of Google has changed a lot in our lives. We can easily find out information, find the necessary places with just one click on the Google toolbar. But is it the modernization, and the most modern development that makes people lazy in thinking? Lazy remembers exactly what you need. Instead of remembering I read them, I can google them. This was the premise for Besty Sparrow's development, discovery, and research into the Google effect. Besty Sparrow and her colleagues conducted four studies that examined how well people remember information. And the results of the experiment were amazing. With simple information, it can be easily accessed and stored as an archive and easily searched on the Internet, on google. The vast majority of them do not remember specifically what they searched for, but instead they remember the source and where it was stored - google. With more complex information, which cannot be encrypted and transmitted to google, people remember longer. It is the opposite that has confirmed that, since google appeared, people are very lazy to think and remember specific information. People are living in the Internet world, not the world of flexible movement and development. The Google effect makes us more confident in what we find. Don't trust your own opinion or point of view. So, to avoid the Google effect, you should learn to read information selectively. And most of all, when you have a problem, instead of picking up your smartphone to google search, try brainstorming and remembering about that problem. Everyone's mentality is different, so the way you look at a problem will also be different. Don't let the Internet dictate your worldview. But consider the Internet as an auxiliary tool for you to develop that worldview.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5.0,déjà vu- the disease that haunts children.,déjà vu diseas haunt child,"Have you ever seen something that feels very familiar? The feeling is both interesting and strange but also full of mystery. The phenomenon that you often see is Déjà Vu. This psychological phenomenon was discovered by the French psychic researcher, Émile Boirac. The name Déjà Vu was also given by him. This psychological phenomenon must have been experienced by everyone once when seeing a situation, a certain case. Déjà Vu psychological phenomenon is very common in children, especially young people. This is still the subject of research of scientists and spiritualists. The fact that a person can see an event or situation in a dream and at some point in the future has happened. Maybe you were sleeping tonight and dreamed that you were walking into the supermarket. The next time you walk into a supermarket, it's practically familiar even if you've never been there. This is Deja Vu. The feeling that it gives is very strange, mysterious but also full of familiarity. It can be said that people with this psychological effect can see the whole future.

4.0,men and women from love to sex,men woman love sex,"Men and women fuck each other from the living room to the dining room to the bedroom. And in that war, one side wins means both sides lose. Love, cohabitation, marriage is a connection between a man and a woman, the nature is multifaceted, there is an interesting side that is not poetic, there is also a happy side but it is bitter because… too life, too real and too shocking! That's why many men I know avoid marriage. Quite simply, men are interested in different things than women. In fact, marriage is not necessarily the only way to guarantee sexual satisfaction. Men have a saying that if you want to drink milk, you have to buy cows? “Eat cake to pay” which is a concept whose origins seem… closer to men, the Vietnamese press uses that word for men also seems to be more common. For a woman, marriage is the only guarantee of her love. If that goal is not achieved, women are willing to call men ""exploiters"", even changing their last name to Chu. Someone told me that men like different types of women, such as perfectly beautiful women, funny women, independent and intelligent women. But what I like best is the ""mother cum prostitute"" type of woman. That is to say, guys like to be tenderly cared for in the dining room and like to be fair and unconditional in the bedroom. While many beauties, after being married, immediately turn themselves into ""boss, mistresses"", both want to hold men mentally and physically, and want to possess men materially - including him. , time and wealth he has. Many women refuse to admit, from the perspective of personal needs, that marriage is actually a woman's search for a ""big man"" or an ""investor"" who is committed to a long-term investment in her life. . Men looking for ""cards"" all their lives can't live together Husband doesn't want to take advantage of marriage to bring home a banker and a pet, family cat or something, have to take care of ""it"" but ""it"" I love being rubbed. bibs, and when I want it but ""it"" doesn't like it, I call it whatever she wants! As a result, the relationship between men and women was complicated even before they decided to get married, and became even more complicated after they unwittingly entered into a marriage contract. Because they interpret every behavior from two completely different angles. Because sex and love interfere with every detail between them. Husband kissing his wife is definitely excited or impulsive, women suddenly run to kiss him, it's not an expression of love or sex, but just a cherished wife. some conspiracy. So, it is only before the age of forty that a woman thinks about changing husbands. And after the age of forty, men start thinking about changing wives. The other day, when drinking with some successful gentlemen, guys in their forties or in their forties all admitted that, now, what is the happiest man in his forties? It's a promotion, a raise, and a wife dies! The sex prism made all the men sitting around the specialty table at the aquarium party that day to laugh, think and… nod! There is an unfortunate woman who has not earned any money in her life, that is called a prostitute - ""thanks to her husband!"" But more unfortunate is that women are not allowed to hold a single penny from men in their whole life, sometimes they have to work to save money to take care of their husbands, husbands, and children. So it's not just money moving from one person's wallet to another, but spending money says a lot more about the bond between women and men than we think. ""Women go to a restaurant without looking at the bill, it must be his lover. And a man who does not look at the bill, does not necessarily become her lover. Once married, a man lets his wife pay, of course"" arguing (And in the case of seeing both men and women) competing for money, chances are high that they are passionately in love, or that both are having a very passionate affair). ""In fact, there are too many people who can't leave each other because of money. Or leave each other and still live under the same roof just for money. Even though the love is broken. I have an acquaintance, on When"" he is about to divorce. , his wife transferred all of the family's assets to someone else's name such as owning a company, owning a production line, owning a small school, and even a few motorbikes worth tens of millions of dollars. relatives on his mother's side, for some reason the husband was not alert to his wife's dangerous symptoms, when he received the divorce form in his hand, the husband knew that his child had also died, so his wife arranged to ""relocate"". disperse” to a safe place thousands of kilometers away. . I comforted my friend, if she still accepts to live together, then she is living with money, not with you. So people still don't waste money? worse than a merchant, such a wife is even worse than a business partner. Because business partners only care about making a profit from themselves, not caring who they are related to, where do they rob their children? I have another friend who lost a lover because of it. It was not because he had no money that he decided to leave his entire large fortune to his wife and children, leaving empty-handed to date a new lover. As a result, this girlfriend cried and left him immediately, as if he had robbed her of her future with her house and car. Sitting in a coffee shop at the end of the year, on the way to find a house to rent alone, my friend said, I don't know if love has that face. At this age, I thought that true love is the most important thing between a man and a woman, but love is not enough! Relationships that last a while are usually stable. Failed men often show off their wives, successful women are women who show off their husbands. Many people love each other so long that they even forget the wedding. Many people have been married for so long that they forget to love each other. And behind those soft ties, are emotions. To see a woman's true face, just wait after she has removed her makeup, removed her makeup, and removed her jewelry and fashionable clothes. If you want to see the real face of a man, you have to wait after breaking up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5.0,paradox of choice - paradox of choice,paradox choic paradox choic,"As one of the psychological effects that help support effective business, the Paradox of Choice effect has brought great profits to many brands. This effect is also known as the “paradox of choice”. Psychologist Barry Schartz described this effect in his book The Paradox of Choice. Accordingly, a large amount of selection is said to lead to internal paralysis. A good example of this is the stalls in supermarkets. Here, customers have a lot of choices for an item. However, if you want to know what you really need, you have to test each item. This helps supermarkets sell many products to many different customers. This is one of the signs that buying sentiment is influenced by the number of choices. Too many products to choose from will leave consumers scattered and unable to decide which is best for them. Not only does it show that the choice decision will be scattered because of the number of products, the Paradox of Choice effect also shows that the more choices there are, the easier it is to make the wrong decision. When you put too many products on the scale, you will not be able to determine which products are most valuable. This is certainly true. So if you want to make the right decision, you need to make some moderate choices. Otherwise, you will make a wrong decision. Another negative emotion can arise from the Paradox of Choice effect. You run the risk of falling into discontent with your own choices. When the selected product does not bring you satisfaction. This leaves you back to comparing it with products you didn't choose. These are all psychological reactions that can occur when you are faced with too many choices. If you know how to take advantage of the psychological reactions of shoppers through the paradoxical effect of choice, you will become a great salesman. Placing a large number of items sorted with a certain intention will help you to clear your inventory quickly. Not only that, you will get more customers due to the opposite effect of choice. For consumers, understanding the principle of this effect will also help you spend more wisely. Should know zoning product selection and set criteria. This helps you choose the most suitable product and minimizes the risk of regret when choosing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5.0,narcissistic syndrome & 6 psychological pitfalls that make love endless,narcissist syndrom psycholog pitfal love endless,"True love always comes from both sides. But narcissists only want to receive, not give, and they always have a way to achieve that wild ambition. Narcissism is a disturbing psychological syndrome. Its English name is ""Narcissism"", derived from the name of a boy in Greek mythology - Narcissus. Legend has it that the boy was so beautiful that the goddess Echo fell in love with him. However, he refused because he thought she was not worthy. Embarrassed, the goddess Echo cursed that Narcissus could forever love only himself. So, day after day, he watched his reflection through the river water, eventually transforming into a flower also named ""narcissus"" (narcissus). Today, narcissism is used to refer to an excessively narcissistic personality, considering oneself to be ""the navel of the universe"", yearning to be honored by others. It is a selfish and blind love! However, most narcissists are very smart and they know how to ""set up"" the following love traps to make the other person's heart flutter. ""Like predators, narcissists also look for specific objects to trap. These are often fragile hearts, people with low self-esteem with a longing for comfort and comfort."" According to psychologist Silvia Horvath, people who are seduced by narcissists are also generally quiet but loving; Dedicated to family, friends and career. So they see (small) common ground with the narcissist - a bit extreme with what they believe in. Even on first dates, the narcissist showers the other with sweet words. Which is “you are really different from the people I dated before”, which is “destiny”, “belongs to each other”… At first, this makes the other person extremely happy. Because narcissists take great care of themselves, they are the best, and they love you wholeheartedly. But that's not true. It was not the development of an ordinary love affair. Dr. Steven Stosny says: “If you feel like a relationship is growing too fast, it is. If you're uncomfortable, then the emotional source matters."" Remember that narcissists often target emotional, vulnerable people? So when interacting with others, the narcissist often The narcissist will pretend to be so innocent, recounting a previous unfinished love affair, or an abusive childhood... For this quick opening... , you should be careful. They may not be lying completely but the purpose of this is still very suspicious. Gas lights are inherently fuzzy, not real. In psychology, ""gas light"" or ""gaslighting"" only a form of emotional abuse Gaslighting happens very slowly Do you know the phenomenon of ""frog in boiling water""? The water will slowly heat up so that the frog won't notice because it's an ectothermic animal, by the time it gets too hot. frogs are dead, so are narcissists, at first they lie very openly, as a joke, if you think they are bad... Lines of delusion make you confused and gradually lose your sense Even worse, the narcissist tells family and friends that you're not okay and want to be alone at the moment. At the same time, they tell you, “I need you by my side more” (remember the “playing pity” trick?). Gradually, you are separated from the person you trust, like losing your real mirrors and leaving only an illusion. By the time you feel like the narcissist's most important person, they've run out of desire to conquer. They have run out of love, even the victim's money, so they are ready to give up their ""role"". Victims also find it difficult to get sympathy from friends and family, as they have not seen each other for a long time and do not know exactly what happened (thanks to the ""gas lamp"" trick mentioned above). ""This makes us - outsiders - understand that sometimes trust in friendship is very important. Don't just listen to one-sided words outside, but have to observe and talk to your friends more!""

4.0,depression & the terrible truth behind it,depress terribl truth,"You may not know that behind the actions that are considered odd, lazy or snobby is a wounded soul. ""Depression is a mental illness that affects millions of people and is on the rise in modern society. Besides spreading the symptoms of the disease, it is more important to everyone around. Sarah Schuster is the mental health editor of The Mighty, and she decided to find out what people with depression do, because their illness isn't visible or recognizable to the average person."" “Most people think that people with depression feel 'very sad' all the time, but it's not until you have it that you really understand what that feels like. Depression manifests itself in many different ways, some people show it outwardly, some don't. For example, some people find it difficult to get out of bed, others just do their job well – each person has a completely different expression.” When Sarah asked The Mighty's Facebook community, ""What are people with depression doing that the average person doesn't realize?"" The following answers will help viewers better understand why what seems normal is an act of depression. I struggled to get out of bed, sometimes for hours. , just thinking about having to shower makes me tired. If I have to do that, I need a little break. People don't understand but the anxiety, depression is draining me, like a professional boxer is facing a battle.” I went to bed at 9pm and slept soundly until 10 , 11 a.m. the next morning in bed it's torture nothing really interests me. I don't like talking in bed on the phone. I prefer texting. Because when texting I feel less pressure. I'm also antisocial. I don't like being around people, but I'm sure people can't stand me. I can deal with depression, but I can't deal with people who say ""we all have our bad times. dark, sad times and then we'll get through it"", ""I'm depressed too and I keep living your life"" – the expression of depression in each person is different from anyone else's . I'm glad some people can deal with it easily but I can't. Agree to social friends' plans but cancel at the last minute. I made up some excuses to say no but it was just because I was too shy to join everyone. Depression makes you think that your friends really don't want to see you, they just feel bad. Sometimes I forget to eat all day. I felt my stomach growl but didn't have the will to get up and cook something to eat. Hide in the phone. Yes, I am addicted to it, but not like everyone else. I don't socialize, I play games or search online stores to distract myself from negative thoughts. It's my safe ""bubble"". In normal social situations, some people don't realize I'm shrinking or speechless because of my depression. Instead, they thought I was rude or trying to be antisocial. I often say that I am tired or feel unwell. Ordinary people don't realize how strongly depression has affected my physical and mental health. I'm having a hard time staying motivated while in a depressive cycle. That means I don't care about things, just let it go. Then after all, there is nothing left, empty. When depressed, I go out to eat more, housework is pushed back, I am afraid to watch movies or read books to escape reality. I used to live with depression. People don't seem to notice it because I always smile when I talk to them and I joke around too, making people think I'm always happy and enjoying life. While my heart is always heavy with thoughts, full of regret and despair. The purpose of my part-time work during the holidays is to avoid spending time with my family. It's overwhelming when people talk about the future around me, so I avoid that time. People think I'm lazy and a parasite because I haven't had a job since I graduated. They didn't realize that I wanted to work more than anyone, but there were countless negative things running through my head that scared me to the point of not daring to print a single application. Isolating myself, not working to the best of my ability just because of it all, laughing and belittling myself. I've said it quite a few times before: I laugh so that I don't cry. Depression is like a demon that always tells me I won't feel happy, have no desire, have no energy, don't eat well, can't see the light. It's like someone stole your soul. You won't understand it until you experience it yourself. I don't want this scary feeling to happen to anyone even if that person is the person I hate the most. Becoming angry, unreasonable, or rude to people I love for a few moments without realizing why. Then I realized my actions and words were wrong and felt bad, because of the gratuitous anger I had vented on them. For me personally, the special thing that I want people to realize is that my depression has made me a 'lazy person', barely keeping in touch with anyone, poor personal hygiene, and reacting uncontrollably. extreme way. Bad times with the most seemingly ordinary things. Doesn't care about basic things like doing laundry, doesn't want to cook or even eat. They think I'm lazy. I fight every day, don't want to give up and try to show myself worthy. When I say I'm depressed, it means I want someone to tell me I'm not alone. Not because I want to get attention. I sat in one place all day, only getting up to go to the bathroom. The chair I sit on is also my bed. I have a bed, but I just sit on that chair. I don't sleep well and I eat very little. The TV is still on, but can I watch or not. I just sat there. My house is a mess.

1.0,why do people use addiction?,peopl use addict,"Some people are at risk of substance abuse and progression to an addiction disorder. Their disorder can have many causes, including genetics, family background, psychological factors, and social norms. Collectively, these factors make substance use more valuable to individuals, even though that decision may be against their long-term interests. Be aware, however, that one cause for one person may not be appropriate for another. Most people at risk of substance abuse do not become addicts. An individual's preference for one action over another is shaped by the interaction between genetics and their past experiences. And the interaction between genetics and social environment may explain why some people are addicted and some are not (Kreek et al., 2005). For example, due to genetic factors, the children of alcoholics are at increased risk of future alcohol problems, and many of these children exhibit high levels of alcoholism. impulsive behavior. The reason a person is involved in substance use is strongly influenced by the community in which the person lives (Wilson, 2005). For example, students will drink more alcohol on campus where there is a strong drinking culture, fewer alcohol control policies on campus, and easier access to alcohol through special “consolidation.” and “affordable” prices from local shops and bars (Sher and Rutledge, 2007). Social norms help us determine under what circumstances and how much alcohol is appropriate. There is evidence that we stop using drugs when prices become too high (Dalrymple, 2006). The states with the lowest smoking rates are those with the strictest indoor smoking laws and high cigarette prices. In general, when the price of cigarettes increases, people will smoke less. The increase in the taxable price for alcoholic beverages leads to a decrease in alcohol and beer consumption in general and intoxication and excessive drinking in particular. Impulsivity is a personality trait that is often cited as a risk factor for alcohol and other substance abuse (MacKillop, 2016). Addicts believe that long-term benefits are not as valuable as short-term benefits. Over-prioritizing short-term benefits and ignoring long-term consequences leads to addiction problems. Self-medication theory holds that the main cause of addiction disorders is suffering (Khantzian, 2012). Specifically, individuals who lack the skills of emotional regulation (suitable for manipulating emotional responses and empathizing with negative emotions) use drugs as an attempt to manipulate negative states. extreme or miserable. Alcohol is often used as a way to deal with social anxiety. The more you stop drinking, at least temporarily, the worse your anxiety will become. Mate (2010) argues that addictive behavior is ultimately born from a reluctance to allow oneself to actually feel and experience the pain, frustration, fear, and all the negative emotions that are inherently part of man. Instead, we use chemical shortcuts to avoid those emotions and end up stuck there. Addicts often don't get enough positive interactions from people to stay happy, and they cling to addictive substances to some extent as self-medicating (Panksepp, 2012). Feeling isolated is the main cause of unhappiness. Personal experience of loneliness is painful. That's why we eat ice cream or other fatty foods while sitting at home and feeling completely alone in this world. In particular, troubles with self-regulation suggest that loneliness manifests itself in alcohol abuse, substance abuse, eating problems, and even suicide. Furthermore, heavy stimulant users may stay away or avoid family or friends who are not users. The social control hypothesis suggests that a lack of attention from family and friends causes people to neglect themselves and engage in unhealthy behaviors, such as unhealthy eating. not practice. The choices that make up the life no one wants are made without thinking about what will happen in the future. They are not considered for long life. In any case, substance use (or overeating) causes only limited harm. Harm occurs after the passion is repeated. No one chooses to be an addict. One day of substance use doesn't mean you're addicted. But as the days piled up, the addictive behavior became increasingly apparent. Thus, a person who never chooses to be an addict will eventually become an addict (Hyman, 2009).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5.0,reciprocity- persuasion or the peak of deception,reciproc persuas peak decept,"In life, helping each other is an extremely necessary thing. If we are happy to give, we will also receive what we deserve. Especially this has also been applied in the field of marketing. So what is reciprocity and why they are applied in business, let's find out below. Reciprocity is a psychological effect explained in Dr. Robert Cialdini's book. Basically, it is understood as the psychology of persuasion. Usually, if you convince them with words, it is not enough, but also needs to be accompanied by actions. This concept is explained very simply as follows, if you give something away, people will naturally want to do something for you. To understand reciprocity more deeply, we will take a practical example. Simply when we go out to eat at a restaurant, when they give us a bill with a candy, that is also one of the reciprocity we are talking about. Because when the staff gives you the bill, there is no candy attached. Then of course you will pay according to the bill as well as the service that the restaurant provides you. But when they include a candy, the percentage of tips the restaurant receives increases to 3.3%. And when the employee gives 2 or 3 candies, the number will increase to 20%, isn't it amazing. It is the mutual help to give and receive in each person's mind. Often in marketing they will have a lot of ways to take advantage of the reciprocity. Another very real example that you often see is free English courses for students who need to get back to basics within 1 month, for example. Then after the course ends, those old students will continue to register for courses available at the center to further improve their level. From giving away something as simple as a raincoat, a video tutorial on an issue that people care about, or simply an exclusive ebook. Even a few small candies like the one in the example above will have a real and lasting effect. As long as you just make sure you're giving something away for free before you want to get it back from someone else.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5.0,psychological framing effect,psycholog frame effect,"For business people especially marketers. They often focus on a lot of psychological effects to hit the psychology of consumers. In particular, they are often applied in marketing to easily influence businesses and customers. More specifically, it is the tendency of people to see the same information about the same object but react in completely different ways. This is the psychological framing effect (The Framing Effect). The Framing Effect is a cognitive bias in which the brain makes decisions about information depending on how the information is presented. This psychological effect is often used for the purpose of increasing business productivity. It is often used so that everyone can get the same information but give different answers based on specific choices that can give a negative frame or a positive frame. Usually when applying this psychological framing effect (The Framing Effect), marketers will divide it into 3 basic frames as follows: The first is the attribute frame. This type of frame often highlights certain characteristics of objects and things in the yin and yang light frame. When this framing effect enhances a desired attribute, customers are more likely to make a purchase, and vice versa. The second frame is the selection frame. This type of framework presents information in the form of a win or lose gamble. When the goods are shaped in terms of the customer, it is easier to agree to the action. This type of framework will pose you a challenge as to what percentage of consumers will accept the risk to avoid losses. Last but not least is the target framework. This type of framework will incentivize consumers by emphasizing negative outcomes when you opt out or participate. The client will then be more likely to take action than if it weren't for this kind of framework. Advertisers and marketers can flexibly use these 3 framing effects in The Framing Effect to change consumers' minds in product selection. Depending on each situation as well as different cases, you should apply each framework so that it is most suitable. A weakness in this psychological effect is that competitors can also use this effect, so we need to be careful when using it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5.0,the mcgurk effect. function,mcgurk effect function,"Image and sound are always two things that go hand in hand. Often we trust what we see more than what we hear. But the truth is quite the opposite. But sometimes the sound will be drowned out by the brain and the naked eye. This is the phenomenon of the McGurk effect (McGurk Effect). So let's learn about this effect. For each person, the ability to hear will help them hear sounds coming out with close amplitude. But sometimes the sound will be distorted due to the interference of the eyes and brain. So often when people close their eyes, they will hear the sound more accurately. Often what people can see overrides what they hear. Why does such a thing happen? Later people called this the McGurk effect (McGurk Effect). The McGurk Effect (McGurk Effect) is explained by a real-life example as follows. All humans are born and grow up hearing dozens of words and mouth shapes associated with those words. As a result, our brain contains a comprehensive map of speech and speech. But when this happens, it's the McGurk effect. That's when the mouth movement we see can overwhelm what we hear. Making our perception of a sound different from what we actually hear. Therefore, only when we close our eyes to feel and really listen with our ears can we feel the message that the speaker wants to convey. A real-life example like the mouth you can see with your eyes is ""ga"" next to it combined with the sound you hear is ""ba"". When these two are combined, the listener will understand it as ""da"". The essence of the McGurk effect (McGurk Effect) is that our vision will overwhelm our hearing with the images we see. Then, when you need to remove them, you just need to close your eyes completely and feel with your own hearing. When you stop visual activity, then hearing will function at its best without being overwhelmed by the brain and eyes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This visitor stopped the other student and said, ""I heard that your teacher is Confucius, your education must be very high. He asked me how many seasons there are in a year? If you answered correctly, I will bow to you, but if you answer incorrectly, you must bow to me."" The other disciple thought for a moment and then said: ""Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter, there are four seasons!"" The other guest argued: “Wrong! There are three seasons!” “This disciple felt that it was very strange, so he said: “There are clearly four seasons in a year, why do you say there are three seasons?” The two argued endlessly, and Confucius came out and said, ""Three seasons!"" The guest was very happy, asked Confucius' disciple to bow before leaving, the disciple was confused and asked Confucius: ""Master! There are clearly four seasons in a year, why did you say there are three seasons just now?"" Confucius replied, ""Didn't you see that person? It was a shapeshifting grasshopper. In a year, the grasshopper lives only three springs, summers and autumns, doesn't it know winter? Wasn't it not enough to argue with him?"" The disciple at that time was enlightened and bowed his head to Confucius's teachings.An old story says that everyone's thought realm is different, each person has their own own stance in dealing with people. petty people are bored of fame and gain, and like to insist on arguing with others.

5.0,thatcher effect,thatcher effect,"Have you ever felt hallucinating when looking at an upside-down image? A photo that looks great, the face is perfect, but what if it's reversed? We will see strange, confusing shapes. That's the Thatcher Effect. Thatcher Effect - Thatcher Effect is a visual effect discovered by Peter Thompson. He is a British cognitive scientist and he discovered this when he saw a picture of Margaret Thatcher – Prime Minister of the UK at the time. What is worth mentioning here is not the photo but our feelings. Even though the picture turned upside down, it looked rather unusual, but I found it to be normal, calmly passing by without feeling scared or strange. In other words, this effect is due to our brain not noticing this! By looking at different angles of the photo, Peter Thompson discovered this effect. When he looks at it from different angles, he sees a gradual change, or in other words a visual illusion that causes us to see an abnormally changing image! Although so far there is no explanation for this effect, we ourselves encounter such cases in life. Our brain perceives everything quite acutely, analyzing and recognizing faces is also extremely sophisticated. And this Thatcher Effect happens when we don't perceive the change in the image. This psychedelic effect also sometimes makes us fail to recognize things. For example, when you look at a picture, in a certain direction, you see it is a frog. But when I turned it back, it naturally turned into a horse. It's strange isn't it? It can also be said that this effect causes our brains to be tricked into recognizing faces. Or maybe our brain has not yet processed when the face is suddenly rotated to a different angle from the original image! You can use this Thatcher Effect to test your ""fine eye"" skills, see if your brain can detect altered images, thereby determining if the brain has a problem. . Timely image processing or not.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2.0,"steps to ""find your way"" into a boy's heart",step find way boy heart,"Dear girls, You have known him for a long time, interested in him for a long time. He might be in the same office, at the same school, in a close group of friends. He doesn't hate you nor alienate you, it's just that you two can't date. You text him, he replies, but he never texts first. When you date, he may hang out with you, but he never actively invites. You feel confused, stuck and tired. Youth is limited, you can't keep hoping for a person without results. How to get rid of him now? Refer to the 5 steps to find your way into the male heart of Modern Psychology. The article is for reference only, with the ""deer"" and inexperienced girls, the ""wolf"" girls may not need reference. This process takes about 1-2 months, and the success rate is at the end of the article. Good luck! You must be liking him because of a random vibration, by a small interest, by a look. And you are turning that love into a piece of your own love story. You are thinking in your head, no matter if he is rich or poor, who is he, how is he, just having him with you is enough? However, when deciding to love someone without knowing who that person is, what kind of person he is, what his future plans are, it is difficult to be sustainable. Therefore, please clearly understand the following issues. Knowing you know me, a hundred battles, a hundred wins, right? 5 steps to find your way into his heart - get to know the object carefully You must answer the following question: If you have a lover, it is very difficult (possibly but difficult) to break the pot to steal flowers. Just broke up, and the relationship with the ex that you keep pushing the book is also broken. Sawing and sawing again and again, but sawing, it must be harrowing... waste of money. If you get rejected a lot, think again. If he is so focused on his career that he doesn't want anyone to stop him, then don't bother him, because men often define careers first and then shape the woman next to them. And he's the type that doesn't care about the future, if you just fall in love, you should think. How is his family? How many people, is he an only child or has brothers? Does his family follow any religion? From very small details but also make you see more clearly about his personality and soul. Does he and you have similar views on life? Two people who have a lot in common will get along better than two people who are complete opposites and complement each other. Love triangles, married people have lovers, unethical cases, ... (this ad reminds me only). If you've read this far and can answer all the questions, you probably already know a lot about him. Some people do not fully understand, can answer all of the above questions, may decide not to flirt anymore because they feel that the object is no longer suitable. However, if your decision is still to flirt with him, please skip to step 2 below. You've known him for a long time but he still hasn't actively cared or texted you once, which shows that you're not impressed enough. So now if you want to change the situation and change the outcome, you can't do it the old way. You don't have to be anyone else, just be yourself and be the best version of yourself. ""Men care about women's souls."" This sentence may sound familiar, but let me tell you that he only cares about the soul of a beautiful woman. Before you know what the soul is like, you have to like it on the outside. Besides, the beauty that everyone doesn't like, even you like, is him, right? Then look at yourself in the mirror? Unruly hair, dark circles under the eyes, acne on the face, old clothes, tanned skin, thin or overweight, messy toenails, dry lips and no lipstick,... ?? Take a look and see if there's anything that needs fixing. Even you yourself can't take care of yourself, how can you be qualified to be by his side to take care of him? (a bit harsh but it's true). Girls sometimes just need to take care of a little, hair, clothes, nails, a little foundation, concealer, eyebrows, eyeliner, lipstick, to be beautiful already. To get in shape, you need to adjust your diet and activities to get back, don't let it go. You say to yourself, “Why am I so confused, not used to it, and do not want to change”? If so, then you should also stop thinking about falling in love with him. Because controlling the psychology of others is not easy at all. And those beauty jobs, thousands of girls out there are still doing very well. Even if you are not beautiful yourself, what do you do? The most important thing is: When you're as pretty as you can be, if he still doesn't like you, there are other guys who are interested in you. Then there are more options for you, right? One arrow hits multiple targets. (Laughs) If you're done, move on to step 3. In a flower forest, people will choose the most special and impressive flower. The person who makes the most impression is not the excellent beauty, but the one who knows how to leave an impression. Therefore, please pay attention to the following. Use a shampoo, a fabric softener, a perfume, and even a single… roll-on deodorant. Do you know why? Simply put, animals find and distinguish mates by scent. After all, man is just a higher animal. He may not remember what color shirt you're wearing, but if you walk past him once and have a pleasant scent, he'll remember it even more. However, that does not mean that spraying perfume on him does not dare to come near and that will ruin everything. Ad once asked a few male friends how highly valued a woman's first impression of a man is. Therefore, every guy likes a girl who knows how to behave politely, gracefully, from the smallest things such as laughing, eating, walking, etc. Because he often thinks: ""Love doesn't mean that you love each other. marry. But if she is lucky to be introduced by her mother later, will her parents be satisfied?"". Therefore, the ladies who walk and stand loudly, talk loudly, eat rice with vegetables, eat while laughing, speak vulgarly, etc. should also reconsider a bit. Because he's a man, he's already strong, he doesn't need another man by his side. Unless he's the ""cool"" type, you should generally keep a feminine side to him. Do you cook well? Nice drawing? Sing well? Handmade? Smart, funny or cool? Remember to make the most of your highlights. How to promote, I will tell in step 4. Just a few short sentences, I can't tell all the ways to get to the position, I will write in the next series. However, if you have already completed this step, please proceed to step 4. You cannot meet someone if you only see them once or twice a month. If there is an opportunity to do something together, actively participate to meet him. Asking him to do something, then inviting him to dinner is also a way to thank him. In general, look for opportunities to meet, and make them as natural as possible. If you have known him for a long time, maybe go to the same school, the same agency, the same sports class, etc., the chances are even greater. So in meetings, try to invest. keep it fresh. Just a small change will make you seem to have an attractive vitality. For example, in the same office, it is common for him to wear this set today, tomorrow to wear another, different colored bags, different shoes, different colored watches, earrings, nail polish colors, etc. something for her to have. . interchangeable. Men often crave the new, seeing you constantly new, he will also find you interesting. So how does it hurt to remember? Why nostalgia? Because they love each other, people remember the scent and warmth of the lover the most. If you succeed, chances are people will remember that moment and crash into the night. (Pay attention to delicate collisions, don't splash coffee, rush into people's houses.. break the job). So you've come a long way, remember to pay close attention to his reaction through each contact. If you are already beautiful, married, missed but he still hasn't taken the initiative to date you, go to step 5. The reason why he hasn't dated or confessed to you is because of the relationship. yours and his are in the two words ""normal"", i.e. normal. It's time to make waves and make him think about you more. The condition in this step is that the signal in the previous steps must be good. And he cares about you. Create a conflict where it's his fault: being late for an appointment, not replying to texts, etc. Even though it's nothing to be angry about, just be angry, let him think more. This step is quite difficult because you have to create the situation yourself, but there is no shortage of situations where he accidentally comes to you indifferently, right? Use one of them as an excuse and say, ""You don't respect me at all if you're late, do you?"" (example) Then change your attitude, don't care about him anymore. 5 steps to find his way into his heart – create attraction From the above situation, he feels disappointed because no one cares anymore, no longer beautiful, memorable, no one to protect him. food arrives. There will be 2 cases: Looking back at the whole process, maybe success or failure is up to you. If successful, then congratulations to both of you. And if you fail, don't be too sad. Because when you are the best version of yourself, you realize your self-worth, realize that your surroundings start to change, beauty starts to notice you and you have a choice again. My way of doing it is not the optimal way but it is also a way for you to have the answer, love is love, if you don't love, there is a stop to still love others, wait until you get tired. Young people do not have much, must live so brilliantly and happily!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2.0,are you emotionally intelligent?,emot intellig,"While many people may just describe themselves as feeling “bad,” emotionally intelligent people can clearly identify that they are feeling “frustrated,” “frustrated,” and “frustrated.” ""disappointed"". or ""worried."" When emotional intelligence (EQ) first came to public attention, it played the role of the missing link in a somewhat odd finding: in 70% of cases, people have average IQs. on average better than those with the highest IQs. This anomaly has shaken many people's perception that IQ is the only factor leading to success. Decades of research show that emotional intelligence is the decisive factor that separates the most successful people from the rest. This connection is so strong that 90% of the most successful people have high emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence is that “something” that is a little elusive in each of us. It affects how we manage our behaviour, act in complex social situations, and make personal decisions to achieve positive outcomes. While EQ is important, its elusive nature makes it difficult to measure and know exactly what to do to improve it. You can always take a scientifically proven test, such as the one that comes with the book ""Emotional Intelligence 2.0,"" but unfortunately most such tests are not free. . fee. So, Travis Bradberry analyzed data from more than 1 million people examined by TalentSmart to identify behaviors that are considered signs of a high EQ. The following are considered clear signs that you have a high EQ. Everyone experiences emotions, but only a few are able to identify them correctly when they arise. The author of the article did research and found that only 36% of us do this, and this is a big problem because unrecognized emotions are often misunderstood, leading to wrong choices. . unreasonable and counterproductive actions. People with high EQ control their emotions because they understand them well, and they use a rich emotional vocabulary to do this. While many people may just describe themselves as feeling “bad,” emotionally intelligent people can clearly identify that they are feeling “frustrated,” “frustrated,” and “frustrated.” ""disappointed"". or ""worried."" The more accurately you choose your words, the better you understand how you feel, what causes it, and what you should do about it. It doesn't matter if they are introverts or extroverts, emotionally intelligent people are curious about the people around them. This curiosity is born out of empathy, one of the most important portals to high EQ. The more you care about other people and what they're going through, the more curious you are about them. Emotionally intelligent people are flexible and constantly adapting. They understand that fear of change can be crippling and a major threat to their success and happiness. They proactively look for and detect impending changes, and plan to act if they occur. Emotionally intelligent people don't just understand emotions; They understand where they are strong and where they are weak. They also know well what types of people motivate them and the environment (both situations and people) that allows them to succeed. Having a high EQ means you know your strengths, how to build on them and use them to your best advantage, and don't let your weaknesses hold you back. Much of emotional intelligence can be summed up in social cognition: the ability to ""read"" other people, understand who they are and what they're going through. Over time, this skill helps you become a very accurate judge of other people's personalities. People are no longer a mystery to you. You know who they are and know their motives, even the hidden things behind them. If you know who you are, it will be difficult for others to say or do something that will startle you. Emotionally intelligent people are often confident and open-minded, which makes them very resilient. You can even make fun of yourself or let others make fun of you because you have the ability to distinguish between funny and offensive. ""Emotional intelligence means self-restraint. You know how to delay gratification and avoid impulsive actions. Research conducted at the University of California, San Francisco shows that the harder it is for you to say 'no', the more likely you are to feel stressed, exhausted, even depressed.Saying “no” is a great test of self-control for many people, but “no” is a strong word. When you say ""no,"" emotionally intelligent people often avoid statements like ""I don't think I can"" or ""I'm not sure."" Saying ""no"" to someone Any commitment It's all about honoring the commitments you already have and giving you the opportunity to successfully fulfill them."" Emotionally intelligent people separate themselves from their mistakes, while still remembering them. By keeping these mistakes at a safe distance, but close enough not to forget them, they have the ability to adapt and adjust for future success. It takes self-discipline to cross the line between memory and obsession. Obsessing over your mistakes will make you anxious and timid, while completely forgetting about your mistakes makes you more likely to repeat them. The key to the balance lies in the ability to turn mistakes into improvements. This makes you more inclined to get up immediately after falling. When someone unexpectedly gives you something without expecting anything in return, this person leaves a strong impression on you. For example, you might have an interesting conversation with someone about a book, and when you see them again a month later, you show up with the book in hand. Emotionally intelligent people build strong relationships because they are constantly thinking about others. ""The negative emotions involved in perpetuating aversion are actually a stress response. Just thinking about it can put your body into 'fight or flight' mode, a mechanism. Survival forces you to fight or flee in the face of a threat. If a threat is imminent, this response is necessary for you to survive, but if that threat is in the past, That stress wreaks havoc on your body and can have serious consequences over time.In fact, researchers at Emory University have shown that continued stress contributes to it. high blood pressure and heart disease Keeping a grudge means you're keeping the stress that comes with it and emotionally intelligent people know how to avoid this at all costs . you feel better in the moment, but it can also improve your health."" Dealing with difficult people is frustrating and exhausting for most people. But people with high EQ control their interactions with toxic people by controlling their emotions. When they are faced with someone who makes it difficult for another, they approach the situation rationally. They empathize with their own feelings and don't allow their anger or frustration to ""add fuel to the fire."" They also consider other people's perspectives and are able to find solutions and common ground. Even when things are completely out of order, emotionally intelligent people can still be rational when dealing with malicious people to avoid hurting themselves. Emotionally intelligent people won't aim for perfection, because they understand that it doesn't exist. It is human nature to make mistakes. When your goal is perfection, you always have a feeling of failure, which makes you want to give up or reduce your efforts. In the end, you spend time lamenting what you haven't achieved, what you should have done, instead of expecting and feeling happy for what you have achieved and will achieve in the future. . ""Taking time to think about how grateful you are for what you have is not only a good thing; it also improves your mood by reducing the stress hormone cortisol (in some cases, the rate of reduction is 23%). Research conducted at the University of California, Davis has found that people who take time each day to cultivate an attitude of gratitude experience improved mood, energy, and physical health. Their results improved. It seems that low cortisol levels played a major role in this outcome."" ""Regularly taking time to ""disconnect"" is a sign of a high EQ, as it helps you control your stress levels and helps you enjoy the present moment. When you force yourself to be ready. Working 24/7, you've put you in front of a constant stream of stressors.Forcing yourself to go ""offline"" and even turning off your phone helps your body and mind. get a break Studies have shown that something as simple as taking a break from checking email temporarily can help reduce stress levels, hopefully you'll be available 24/7.It's hard to enjoy the moment relieve stress after work if an email that has the ability to help you get back to work (ie stress relief) can be sent to your phone at any time."" ""Drinking too many caffeinated beverages can stimulate the release of adrenaline, the main source of the 'fight or flight' response."" This mechanism can replace rational thinking with speed of reaction to ensure survival. This is great if you're being chased by a bear, but not so great when you're paying. Responding to Emails is somewhat impolite When caffeine puts your brain and body into this super-stressful state, your emotions can overwhelm reason. The nature of caffeine ensures you will feel the same way. for a long time while it is slowly being released from your body. People with high EQ understand that caffeine can cause problems, and they don't let the stimulant misunderstand them."" recharge, rearrange the memories of the day, store or discard them (thus creating dreams) so that you wake up awake. High EQ people understand that their self-control, attention, and memory are all impaired when they don't ""get enough sleep or sleep."" incorrect sleep. So they consider sleep a top priority. The more you nibble on a negative thought, the more power you give it. Most of our negative thoughts are just thoughts, not facts. When you feel like something always or never happens, it's just the brain's natural tendency to consider threats (to exaggerate the frequency or severity of an event). . negative and towards a new, more positive outlook. When your sense of fulfillment and happiness comes from the opinions of others, you are no longer in control of your own happiness. When emotionally intelligent people feel happy about something they've done, they won't let anyone's sarcastic remarks or comments take away that happiness. While you can't ""turn off"" your own reaction to what others think, you don't have to compare yourself to others. This way, no matter what others think or do, your self-worth always comes from within.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5.0,anchoring effect,anchor effect,"Perhaps not many people know or understand about the anchor effect. Because in fact, our mind is greatly influenced and affected by this effect. Because anchoring thoughts will greatly affect your thoughts. It works not only through the subconscious mind, but also through many other forms. Even though they have nothing to do with it. Everything you need to know about anchor effects To be able to understand and apply many of these effects most effectively. Then we need to understand a little bit about this effect. It is considered a very unique effect that you should know about. The origin of the anchoring effect is from the first information that appears. When you make a decision, this effect will affect the thinking to make the decision by comparing with the previous decision. In other words so you can easily visualize. You can refer to the following example. Given that the cost to produce item A is 50,000. Then when a price is given to calculate the price, what will the next product cost? Surely the price decision will only revolve around A's initial set number of 50,000. The application of the anchor effect in business Surely everyone in the business world will know this effect. Because it really has an extremely important role that you need to learn and know. Isn't it hard to use irrelevant information to influence thinking? Because our psyche is always influenced by the first anchors that come first. From there, it will have a huge impact on our subconscious. Keeps you in control and always moving towards what was originally heard. Therefore, business people can use irrelevant information to influence the price of products that customers want to buy. For example, use an impressive number at the beginning when referring to the product line sold. Although the number has no correlation with that product. But it has a great effect on the subconscious of shoppers. They were impressed by that heavy number, so they always thought that the price of that product must have an equivalent number. That makes them, when they know the actual selling price, always decide to buy immediately. Because it makes them have a pre-existing comparison that is dominated by the original information. That is the effect of the anchor effect.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2.0,the secret of scarcity,secret scarciti,"What is scarcity? This is a concept that not everyone understands. Its English name is scarce. In what field does it represent the relationship between finite and infinite? For example, economy, goods, services, biology, resources, etc. To what extent will the correlation between these two factors show scarcity? So, in what areas will this factor be present? Just more or less in the relationship between the finite and the infinite. Today's article will talk about scarcity in the field of goods and services. This is the core area that is heavily affected by this problem. Why consider scarcity in any industry? In goods and services, is scarcity present when the good is measured at zero price? Meanwhile, the demand is high and much greater than the supply. From there, scarcity will ensue. If this factor is considered, this situation will happen with any type of service or goods. Because not all sources of goods and services have enough sources to serve production. In addition, other factors such as technology, machinery, techniques and skills of workers also have a great impact on this issue. That rate will also change and cannot meet the needs that people want. However, if people have enough conditions to meet the production of goods and services, it is much more than the actual demand. Then scarcity will not occur. Only if it is assumed that the price offered by the product is zero. While human needs do not exist. Such is still considered to be scarce. There should be a clear definition of scarce resources. Because it is the basis to help people accurately determine their level and production ability. Therefore, it is necessary to have clarity about this limit line for proper production planning. If this human resource cannot be identified, production will not be efficient. It is a form of artificial scarcity. Created by humans without calculating, accurately considering the factors involved in production. So, to avoid scarcity, one needs to consider the number of workers, the amount of machines, equipment and infrastructure that can be used in production. Avoid waste as well as shortage of necessary human resources so as not to affect the production process.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5.0,the decoy effect – and the trap for the customer,decoy effect trap custom,"“The Silence of the Lambs” is a critically-acclaimed popular film. The film has elements of horror mixed with crime elements and has won five Oscars including best actor for Anthony Hopkins, who excelled in his portrayal of a psychopath. Prominent physicist and serial killer, Dr. Hannibal Lecter. This character has personality disorder, a disease that has been studied by scientists and psychologists for a long time compared to other diseases. This article will focus on the diagnosis, and propose methods to cure the disease that Dr. Lecter is suffering from, and will also analyze a bit about the case of Le Van Luyen written by the author. The article found that this criminal has behavior quite similar to other famous serial killers in other history. From the very beginning of the film, Dr. Lecter has been portrayed by other psychologists as a liar, monster, dangerous, and cannibal. He committed a number of serious crimes including murder and cannibalism of his victims. However, when Agent Starling as well as the audience has a chance to see him, he appears as a polite, elegant, well-behaved, and caring person. However, not long after that, the attractive personalities we see turn out to be just a cover that he uses to deceive others, thereby getting what he wants, even if it is on the condition that he live in a better environment than Agent Starling's childhood. past. He then used this cover to kill two policemen and skinned one to make a mask to help him escape, while the other he gutted and hung up as a decoration. In addition, Lecter also killed an ambulance crew and a tourist, stealing people's clothes and wallets so he could escape more easily. Lecter in turn committed serious, life-threatening crimes with a calm attitude, without hesitation and without remorse. In another case, he ate a nurse's tongue and his blood pressure did not exceed 85 (85 is normal blood pressure). This shows that killing and torturing others is normal for Lecter. The above actions are completely consistent with one of the diagnostic symptoms of the disease that he may have, which is not following social norms, not respecting the law reflected in his actions. . action may lead to criminal prosecution. Dr. Lecter's next symptom is that he never tells the truth. Instead, he prefers to hide the truth in every lie. He makes anagrams of diversionary clues when he reveals to Agent Starling that he knows there is a warehouse rented by his patient Hester Mofet but is in fact the warehouse's owner. that's the guy. Hester Mofet after anagram will become ""the rest of me"". He flirted with the FBI agents and dragged them into the game he created whether they wanted to or not. He directs people to do what he wants regardless of whether they realize they are being manipulated or not. He forces Agent Starling to tell him about his past in exchange for information about Buffalo Bill. This is the manifestation of the second symptom: deception, expressed through lying repeatedly, taking advantage of allies and manipulating others to benefit themselves or just for fun. Lecter's third symptom is that he doesn't have any remorse or pity for others. In one scene, when he meets a congressman whose daughter has been kidnapped by Buffalo Bill, he shows no sympathy for his father's misfortune and asks disrespectful questions as if he were raising his daughter. with breast milk. He liked to make her angry just because he liked it. Absent any mercy or remorse, apparently without even realizing that one's own actions hurt others, is the third standard symptom for the diagnosis. Through the above 3 criteria, based on the DSM-5, it can be seen that Dr. Lecter is suffering from Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD). The characteristics of the disease are evident in actions that do not care, infringe on the rights of others, which we have detailed above. For Lecter to be formally diagnosed with ASPD, evidence of past conduct disorder up until age 15 is required. Moral disorder is described as a person engaging in aggressive, aggressive, destructive, deceptive, and law-breaking behaviors. This disease is used as a guide to identifying ASPD in adulthood. In other words, for a person to be diagnosed with ASPD, he or she must have been diagnosed with a moral disorder while in his teens, i.e. before the age of 15. And ASPD is also one of the only personality disorders to be diagnosed. have another condition identified at an early age to base the diagnosis on. Having antisocial personality disorder doesn't always lead to antisocial personality disorder, but having certain antisocial personality disorder will also lead to moral disorder in childhood young. People with ASPD rarely seek medical care on their own. They are neither motivated nor able to see the consequences of their antisocial behavior. There is very little research on the treatment of this disease. All resolution plans focus on juvenile offenders and some are removed from the legal system. Outcomes were measured by the frequency of recidivism rather than the change in personality-related behavior as determined by the disease. For greater clarity, outcomes from treatment modalities were measured in terms of how often patients committed crimes, the length of time between offenses, rather than attempting to change perceived personality behavior. manifestations of the disease such as deceiving, manipulating, and taking advantage of others. Cognitive-behavioral therapy also has little effect. Another study found that taking a multivitamin may also curb crime. In Dr. Lecter's case, he was a psychopath but effective. This means he can hide his unusual behavior in certain social situations and maintain a positive image while committing grisly crimes behind the scenes. At the beginning of the film, we can see when Agent Starling searches for information about him, a series of articles praise him as a genius in psychology, inventing many good methods and theories. It was only later that it was revealed that he was the deadliest serial killer. Lecter never thought he was sick, he always considered the people around him stupid, the sheep waiting for him to be slaughtered, he enjoyed watching other people scratch their heads and run around in traps he stretched out. go out. So he is the last person on earth who can think about his problem and seek help. The DSM-5 has criteria for diagnosing the disease by a combination of symptoms. The symptom category-based method of diagnosis (diagnosis is based on whether the patient has these symptoms, not whether the patient has severe or mild symptoms) makes it easier for doctors to diagnose the disease. DSM-5 has all 7 symptoms as criteria but only 3 symptoms are enough to define pathology. Although the DSM-5 is written as a symptom category, at the same time personality disorders are defined based on the direction of the symptoms. The section on ASPD is emphasized on hypocrisy to deceive for profit. This severity-based diagnostic system maintains a certain continuity with the category system, providing clinicians and physicians with a better description of each patient and severity. minor illness that the person has. One drawback of the DSM-5, however, is that it blurs the line between crime and disease. This criterion is difficult to apply to a person without a criminal record. For example, if this person has ASPD but is very good at hiding his behavior and has never been caught, it is difficult to officially diagnose this person with ASPD based on the DSM. And if by this standard, more than 80% of prisoners in prison have this disease. In Le Van Luyen's case, his dehumanizing behaviors based on DSM-5 were symptoms that suggested he might have ASPD. He can calmly map out a murder plan and then calmly execute it, chase and kill the victim at the root, even an 18-month-old baby will not spare, using a gentle face, taking advantage of the pity of his loved ones, family. family to hide the crime (intimidating her aunt not to show up) and hide. Even when he was arrested, he remained calm, his face expressionless and showed no signs of fear. No one would have expected Luyen to kill all 4 people in Ngoc's house, go down to get property, then calmly open the refrigerator, get drinking water all the way from the 1057 milestone to the Border Guard post about 5km long, the name Luyen still keep calm. However, due to the fact that her past has no evidence, there is no manifestation of moral disorder because most of her comments are ""gentle, docile"", so it is not possible to officially diagnose her with ASPD. Some other famous serial killers such as Dennis Lynn Rader, Henry Lee Lucas also have similar manifestations as Le Van Luyen, teenage killers without moral expression, disturbing behavior. , but it only manifests clearly and violates the rights of others in adulthood, so Le Van Luyen can be classified in this group of names in the section Antisocial personality disorder in adulthood. is the focus of research of different departments. Research (Other conditions may be the focus of clinical attention.) That's the difference between Antisocial Disorder and Adult Antisocial Disorder, plus, overall, These two forms are similar. But this is just my speculation based on the details described from the press, so it may not be true as the press sometimes exaggerates the details. About two years ago, when I first started this series of articles on psychology and disease, the first article I wrote was ASPD, in which I wrote a short piece on the causes of this illness. If you are ready, copy it here so that people will not wonder about the cause of the disease and save money on long-term treatment. This article and the first one I wrote academically there is almost no difference except the first one is based on DSM-4 and focuses on symptoms with serial killers as an example , and the other article. In this article, I used the DSM-5 and focused on a fixed-character diagnosis with diagnostic criteria as a guide, so this article can be considered the most up-to-date. Biologically, people with this condition have little or no activity in the sympathetic nervous system. Regarding the sympathetic nervous system, it is a major part of the autonomic nervous system, responsible for unconditioned reflexes. For example, in the middle of the night you are alone at home, suddenly you hear something rattling outside the door, your body can't help but feel scared, your hands are sweaty, your whole body is in a state of tension. The sympathetic nervous system is responsible for those unconditioned responses. But patients with ASPD rarely, very rarely, have these fear reactions, or in other words almost none. Therefore, they are considered ""sick"" and insensitive, without any sympathy or pity as I mentioned above. Writing is long, typing is tiring, so I will stop here. In short, people with ASPD are very dangerous, very crazy, and fearless people. While searching for research on treatments, I read on several websites that instead of suggesting cures for patients, they offer choices about how to live with and protect themselves. protect yourself against people with ASPD. Usually, the articles that I read about psychological diseases, most of the authors have sympathy and pity for the patients and their loved ones, but for ASPD patients, most of the authors only Express sympathy for loved ones only. As with ASPD, for adolescents with Ethical Disorders, psychologists will focus on the patient's parents and suggest ways to manage and approach problems and troubles caused by their children. go out. I think it's because psychologists and doctors don't have any treatment for ASPD or moral disorder patients, so they focus on the relatives of the sufferer, hoping these people don't go crazy. for patients with ASPD. at the same time, they can protect themselves, partly manage sick children, brothers and relatives, and prevent it from spreading out and causing harm to society. . In short, the victim of ASPD in the words of today's youth is from death to injury!!!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4.0,hallucinations schizophrenia – dangers you need to watch out for,hallucin schizophrenia danger need watch,"Psychedelic schizophrenia is a dangerous disease. They make the patient always live in a feeling of fear and anxiety. They always believe stories and believe it to be true even when there is no clear proof. Introduction to psychedelic schizophrenia syndrome hallucinogenic schizophrenia syndrome has the scientific name of Paranoid Schizophrenia. Initially, people with this syndrome are always dominated by clinically unstable delusions and often accompanied by hallucinations. It may be an illusion that your life is being threatened by your loved ones. Or, in general, the illusion of being harmed. Those hallucinations will appear with more frequency if not detected and treated in time. People at high risk for hallucinogenic schizophrenia are those with a family history of schizophrenia. Elderly fathers also make babies more susceptible to disease. External influences on the brain also increase the risk of the syndrome. People with paranoid schizophrenia will always have the illusion that their lives are in danger. They will always live in fear and anxiety. They can consider the sharing and questions of colleagues around them as if they are taking their information to provide a mysterious organization. Or they always feel that the other person is cheating on them and is always demanding, making the relationship more stressful than ever. From those delusions and worries, the patient becomes more isolated and does not share his thoughts with others. As a result, the level of delusions of being harmed further increased. How to cope with paranoid schizophrenia For people with paranoid schizophrenia, the care and attention of loved ones is extremely necessary. The patient's next of kin should always monitor the patient's medication intake. When caring for a person with delusions, it is important to ensure that the content of the patient's delusions is not contested. Action must always be taken to guide the patient's contact and promote living in harmony with the current living environment. In particular, any impact of family members on the patient should be monitored by a psychiatrist. To ensure the best and most appropriate treatment for each person.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4.0,how to deal with stress – stress,deal stress stress,"Stress is one of the great obstacles in life. It is a common serious problem and also a cause of confusion. Therefore, we need to understand the nature of stress, find out why we get stuck in this spiral of misunderstandings and meaningless preoccupation. A friend told me that they are stressed because of the economic crisis, because of their business, because of their family and many other things, etc. Out of curiosity, I looked up the dictionary to see how stress is explained. by modern scholars and have come up with the following definition: “Stress is the result of an inability to adapt to change.” I think, to some extent, they were right. Stress is the result of rigidity and an inability to accept reality. In other words, it is a strong attachment to something, to a certain way of doing or thinking, it is the clinging to expectations and outcomes that causes stress. When we expect too much, we also fear that our expectations won't come true, things won't go as planned, as we wanted. And so we get stressed. Today, a lot of people come to me complaining that they feel exhausted and can't sleep well. Our minds move like wild animals, spinning with thoughts, plans, deadlines after deadlines. So, even though we don't have to be physically active, we drain our minds and put unnecessary stress on ourselves. We even get stressed out in our dreams. We toss and turn most of the day without knowing that we are destroying ourselves. I think, to some extent, this is the complete opposite of confidence. That's why we feel insecure and stressed. Life is really taking us away, we don't know whether to stop or slow down even for a moment. Sometimes I get nervous when I think about this too. A friend of mine burst into tears when he said that although he is very successful in his business, he is also tired of always trying not to fall behind. Although he earns a lot of money, he still has to work day and night to maintain that wealth. I guess, when he started his business, he must have thought, “When I make a million dollars, I will be very pleased”, but now that he has achieved this goal, he has set his sights even higher. . and self-stress. So he is always tense and does not have a moment of peace. Finally, he came to me in tears and stuck, not knowing how to relieve this burden. We too often get stuck in relationships this way. An old friend told me that when she got married a few years ago, she thought her dream had come true, but now they broke up because she couldn't take it anymore. The problem with both of these friends was that they mistook external things, like money or a good partner, as the key to happiness. That's why I often talk about accepting and letting go of all expectations, instead being grateful for what we have here, right now. If you keep looking for a solution somewhere out there, you will never get rid of stress. But if you walk with awareness, joy, with a generous heart, you will experience happiness and leave all worries behind. Have you ever asked yourself this question? Answering this question is a rare opportunity and also a sign that it is time for you to change. All of us, myself included, should take the time to be ""turtles"". Try taking the train slowly, slow down and slowly. Then everything will be illuminated, life will appear like a picture with vivid details that you have never noticed before, your heart will be filled with gratitude. Even in the face of adversity, you will not be discouraged because we have learned to be grateful for our own difficulties or obstacles. Do you agree that every time we slow down, we see things more clearly, more vividly? When I asked him why he didn't practice diligently every day, some disciples told me that they didn't have enough time. Some people even think that because I don't have to worry about doing business, I don't have to struggle to make a living, so I don't get stressed and don't understand their difficulties. If they knew how many people I had to take care of, how many babies and sick people and how many monasteries I had to take care of, they would probably realize that I understand stress better than anyone. I remember when I was planning to build a school for nuns, one in Ladakh and the other in Nepal, I wondered a lot. I sit all day calculating and thinking. At the end of the day, I realized I had wasted a day worrying with no results. Indeed, stress is a waste of time and stifles our creativity and potential. I advise my disciples instead of wasting time worrying to return to practice. When your mind is stuck in tension, indecision, and feels like there's no way out, take a moment to meditate and relax. You should remind yourself of the meaning of impermanence and cherish life. That way, even when things go awry, you stay optimistic and fearless. Happiness always stems from willpower, not depending on external conditions. I always hope my friends and disciples continue to practice diligently because that is the core of life and truth. delighted. Without this understanding, we are prone to succumbing to the vicissitudes of life. On the contrary, diligent practice will help us keep the faith to keep going. If in life, we are always bound by conservative habits related to traditions, customs, rituals, culture or unreasonable standards set by ourselves, we will be stressed. If we don't follow those conventions, we feel like we'll get in trouble and be ""labeled"" as troublemakers. A lot of our stress stems from this cause. Of course, we still need certain rules. The Buddhist teachings themselves also contain foundations and principles with the aim of becoming a fulcrum to help practitioners on the path of practice. But on the other hand, Buddhism also encourages us to free ourselves from stereotypes to reduce stress and eliminate ignorance. Having to always try to be like someone or act according to predetermined formulas will soon tire us out and stress us out. You try to appear calm on the outside, but inside you feel stuck and confused… You want everyone and even yourself to behave in one way or another, and get angry easily when things don't go your way. happened as intended. We are perfectionists, clinging to our prejudices, expectations, and fears, but in the end, how can everything in this world be perfect? This is like nothing is completely wrong, it all comes down to our subjective opinion. So there's nothing to be afraid of, just trying your best is enough!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4.0,applying social proof in marketing,appli social proof market,"Nowadays, young people often tend to choose according to the crowd. For example, there is a certain restaurant that is reviewed by a celebrity. Soon, the shop will be pulled over and tried by everyone. Why such a strange phenomenon? So please tell you this is the viral effect (Social Proof) and it is also being applied a lot in the advertising strategy of the business. Social proof is briefly explained that people will readily accept the actions or beliefs of a person or group of people they like or trust. A real-life example is that if no one is on the dance floor, no one will dare to go. But when there are a few people going to Mass, there will be a whole crowd of people in attendance. This is the contagion effect. For example, you want to confirm the quality of a certain product but are still confused. Then, the voices of experts, bloggers, influencers related to the product you are using confirm that they have used this product and found it effective. Then you will immediately choose to buy the product without hesitation. Or even endorsements from celebrities. Especially if you are a fan and love your idol. Then how they use costumes, check in at restaurants, you are also interested. This will make the products they use more popular. Advertisers often apply this social proof effect on their social networking sites. Like websites that will have a 5-star review section, for example. When consumers visit their website and see this review, they will trust and buy more than those without reviews. In addition, the use of celebrity influence is also very common nowadays in viral effect. Especially on websites like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter... Their personal pages about fashion, skin care products are very interested by fans. It also affects people's buying behavior.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4.0,interesting facts about human psychology,interest fact human psycholog,"In the world of human behavioral psychology, psychological researchers endeavor to conduct research to better understand the nature of behavior. As a result of psychological studies designed over many years, many novel and significant findings have been reported. Here is a list of interesting human behavioral psychology studies that have been discovered that may surprise you. Our attitudes influence our behaviour. But according to human behavioral psychology, our behavior can also have a direct influence on our attitude under the right circumstances. For example, if you've been on a diet, say you're committed to the diet. You believe that sugar is your enemy and should stay away from it. Moments later, you sneak a chocolate bar. And you feel guilty. Your behavior (stealth) is the opposite of your beliefs (road is the enemy). This psychological discomfort is considered by psychologists to be cognitive dissonance, a state of tension between what you have done and what you are aware of. How do you release guilt? According to human behavioral psychology, one way is to modify your attitude. Your actions have caused a change in your attitude. If you are a parent, you can change your child's attitude for the better. If you are subtle, forcing them to do something they don't like at first (like taking out the trash), chances are their feelings about work will become more positive over time. time. They may believe that taking out the trash is “not so bad”. We often feel let down when we meet someone whose views and beliefs seem inconsistent. You will conclude that the person is ridiculous. But from the perspective of human behavioral psychology, attitudinal inconsistencies (and inconsistencies between attitudes and actions) are also quite common. Although we can think logically, that doesn't mean we always do. Sometimes, we are torn between two emotions or can't decide what to do. That doesn't mean we're crazy. It just means we are human. Have you ever tried to convince someone that their point of view was inconsistent and therefore wrong? That's not the way to build a relationship. Consider the possibility that your point of view is wrong and find out why the person's point of view doesn't align with theirs. And if someone accuses you of being inconsistent, you can respond: “Human nature can be inconsistent, and anyway, what seems inconsistent to someone. then it's consistent for others. Example: Does watching violent movies on TV cause children to behave aggressively? One person said that it is for sure and we need to completely ban violent shows. Others say no, because a lot of kids watch violent movies and they don't behave aggressively. Arguments like these often get louder, repeat their point of view, and resolve nothing. They failed to consider one of the most important principles of human behavioral psychology: There is rarely one and only one cause for a behavior. Much of the behavior is caused by many factors that interact with each other simultaneously. Next time you're wondering what led to someone's actions, don't fall into this trap. If you do, you run the risk of ignoring other factors that contribute to the behavior. Consider the possibility of more than one interacting factor causing the behavior. It will help you to gain a deeper understanding of human behavior psychology. People often like the idea that they have the ability to read body language. For example, body language experts on TV read other people's body language to detect if they are lying. But the truth is that there is no human behavioral psychology training that leads to a psychology PhD in the field of reading body language. Why? Because there is no experimental support (experimental evidence) for the idea that anyone, including psychologists, can accurately read unspoken emotions based on human body movements. . body. You might say, ""I can read, tell my kids what they're thinking just by watching them."" Of course you can. Because you understand them better than others. You don't ""read"" them; that you understand them. Psychologist Paul Ekman studied this. He examined the human ability to detect deception in strangers (2009). On average, the participants' accuracy was about 53%. And here's the bottom line: It's best not to assume you understand what's going on in someone's head…unless they tell you. But this method also has problems when people can misinterpret each other's words. Ideally, if you want to know what someone is thinking, ask them. And be wary of people who claim to be experts at reading body language. If body language conveys a clear message, you don't need an ""expert"" to read it. Want to change someone's behavior? You can do that easily if you practice the two most basic psychological techniques – Reward and Punishment (Skinner, 1976). As a simple example, when a child does something right like tidying up his toys after playing, you reward him with his favorite ice cream. On the other hand, if your child engages in undesirable behaviors such as smashing toys when angry, you will punish him by not allowing him to play video games for a certain period of time. However, you need to be aware that bonus and penalty values will change over time. If you give your child one ice cream at a time, they can ask for two the next time. Likewise, the child may ""get over"" your harsh punishment. Therefore, there should be a constant change in rewards and punishments. According to human behavioral psychology, if you combine the two techniques of Reward and Punishment with Patience, you will be able to control the behavior of others without their knowledge. On “The Tonight Show” there was a column called Jaywalking. People were randomly approached on the street and asked to answer a few simple trivia questions. For example: ""Who is the Vice President of the United States"", ""How many states are there in the United States"". However, many people answer incorrectly, or even fail to answer. Why? That's because they interviewed on the spot, didn't have time to rummage through their memories, and the camera was right in front of them. That puts people in a state of anxiety. Since primitive times, humans have been forced to always find ways to deal with dangers from nature, so ""anxiety"" is considered one of the basic states for survival. According to human behavioral psychology, when we are worried, the brain will automatically focus maximum energy to solve the danger, so thinking declines very quickly. Therefore, when we are anxious, we will not be able to do the job well (Yerkes & Dodson, 1908) When you are in an unprepared situation, try to take the time to reflect and calm down. if you feel stressed. Don't promise when you're happy, don't make decisions when you're sad, don't let your emotions fool your ability to think clearly. Everyone thinks that the person who knows us best is none other than ourselves, it seems that simple. However, when something bad happens, we often blame circumstances. In other words, we make excuses for ourselves. But when we judge others, we assume that what happens is because of the other person's weakness, so the novelty is broken. Human behavioral psychology calls this the actor-observer effect (Asch, 1946, Jones & Nisbett, 1972). If someone makes a mistake, it's simply their own fault, not the compulsion of circumstances. When we judge our own abilities relative to others, people tend to overestimate themselves and underestimate others (Suls, Lemosk, &Stewart, 2002; Kruganski & Mayselers, 1990). You should understand that other people see you differently than you see yourself, and that's completely normal. Don't jump to the conclusion that they're jealous of you. The bottom line is that you should learn to listen from others, apply it properly to become more complete.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4.0,do you know crying is also an effective healing solution,know cri effect heal solut,"Crying is a completely normal psychological expression when we are happy or sad. However, not many people know that when we cry, we are healing ourselves, patching up physical pain as well as being able to heal minor eye injuries.

5.0,how does behavioral psychology affect people?,behavior psycholog affect peopl,"Behaviorism, also known as Behavioral Psychology, is a theory of learning based on the view that all behaviors are learnable under (conditioned) conditions. Conditioning occurs through the object's interactions with the environment. However, every theory will have its pros and cons, and so are behavioral theories. Here are the pros and cons of behavioral psychology for the interested reader. Behavioral psychologists believe that a person's response to environmental stimuli is what drives behavior. Behaviors can be systematically learned and clearly observed from the outside without going into deep psychological happenings. Essentially, one only considers observable behaviors—things like perceptions, emotions, and moods, which are difficult to examine. Purely behavioral psychologists believe that anyone is capable of being trained to do a certain job regardless of genetic background, personality traits, and inner thoughts. (with minimal material conditions, of course). The only requirement here is to give a matching condition. One of behavioral psychology's greatest strengths and weaknesses is its ability to clearly observe and measure behavior. In its early formative phase, behavioral psychology ushered in a new era, saving late 19th and early 20th century psychology from crisis. For the first time in the history of psychology, behavioral psychology brings human behavior, human social life into the object of psychology. Firmly opposed to earlier schools of idealistic psychology. Construct a completely new objective psychological theory. Regardless of the advantages and disadvantages of behavioral psychology, behaviorism has provided many valuable arguments for the education and training of people. Giving meaningful arguments in building social psychology, studying human behavior. In particular, behavioral theory has been studied and applied very successfully in modern psychology when it is edited and combined with other schools. Making a great contribution to psychological counseling: client approach, behavioral therapy, psychotherapy, human resource management, people management, educational methods... Behavior therapy is widely applied. widely used in therapy and counseling, especially for those seeking to change inappropriate behavior. Behavioral therapy is often applied with high efficiency such as: phobia disorder; stress, children with psychological disorders, feelings of hopelessness; sexual harassment… People often use it in issues related to geriatrics, pediatrics, stress relief, behavior adjustment. In some other fields such as business management or education can also use this therapy. This treatment intervention time is not long but can bring the desired results, so it is widely used. Considering the advantages and disadvantages of behavioral psychology, first, behavioral psychology has assimilated human behavior and animal behavior. The approach is only externally observable as single data. Besides, it throws consciousness out of the psyche and mechanically separates consciousness from behavior. Second, behaviorism considered man as a reactive organism, ""a machine in constant motion. physical reason"", they erased all principled boundaries between animal and human behavior. . This is the main cause of the disintegration of behaviorism. Attempts to develop behavioral science on an objective, progressive basis have collapsed with the notion that humans have only passive responses, and are therefore dependent on active stimuli. doing this and that, making people no longer the owner, become the performer, behavioral theory only pays attention to the behavior, not understanding the causes and origins of those types of behavior, this theory completely excludes whole higher-order behavior such as consciousness, development. In the process of constructing behavioral psychology, most behaviorists ignore the category of behavior and switch it to the category of reaction. In behavioral theory, there is no category of action, only a category of reaction. Behavioral psychology has yet to solve two fundamental problems faced by the psychology of the time: There is no way to find a qualitative difference between animals and humans, and because of this there is no way. consciousness research. Overall, behavioral psychology has failed to overcome the dualistic, animist, mechanistic, and metaphysical properties of introspection psychology as Watson had hoped. With the advantages and disadvantages of behavioral psychology as above, until now, behavioral theory no longer holds the dominant position as before, but it still has a great impact to help us understand more deeply about psychology. learn people. Conditioning itself helps us understand many different types of behavior, from how humans learn to the development of language.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5.0,psychological nuances of boys when flirting with someone,psycholog nuanc boy flirt,"In love psychology, flirting is the beginning of a relationship, but that doesn't mean we stop flirting once we fall in love. So how to flirt properly, let's find out through this article! Flirting is an integral part of love. Whether we like it or not, it is undeniable, the first moments of acquaintance and flirting are always imprinted in our memories later when we recall our past love, when we re-read messages or messages. In their first courtship, there were no couples who didn't laugh happily. Therefore, to truly understand love psychologically, you must master the art of flirting. Several studies on the psychology of love by psychologists Martie Haselton G. and David M. Buss of the University of Texas have shown that flirting is how people know who is right for them. most without risking… sex. . Accordingly, in the process of flirting, both men and women have the opportunity to observe more closely the object they are aiming for. The brain when in love according to psychology will analyze the information received to come to a final conclusion. During courtship, two people will spend the most time together, will open up and reveal themselves, share thoughts to get to know each other better. Psychological studies on love show that, right from this stage of conversation, the other's personality traits are revealed to help us understand whether it's the other half we're looking for or not. . Usually, in love psychology, single people tend to flirt to find their other half. Meanwhile, most people who are in love, even married, always think that ""the board is built"" so flirting is not necessary anymore. This is a completely incorrect view. Few people know that flirting is the medicine that helps maintain the lasting happiness of couples. A 2012 study by Professor Brandi Frisby of the University of Kentucky on 164 couples found that in love, psychologically, couples often use jokes like the first time to create a sense of stimulation. for the opponent. rather than an ordinary action. As a result, they have stronger and longer lasting love relationships with each other than other normal couples. David Dryden Henningsen, a professor of communication studies at Northern Illinois University, studied 200 college students, including 101 female students and 99 male students, to determine their motivations when they flirted. wake up a girl. opposite sex in love according to psychology. After his research, he suggested that there are 6 different reasons why people flirt. It's sex (finding a mate); play (selfie); explore (try new sensations); relationship (serving work interests); respect (admiring others) and purpose (taking advantage for personal gain). Among these reasons, 25% of men's flirting behavior is flirting with jokes, 30% is to attract the other's sincere feelings, 45% is divided equally among the remaining reasons. There are countless ways to get your partner's attention, but psychological studies on love show that the fastest way to approach your partner is just ""opening up"". No matter how handsome and attractive you are, if you don't dare to start a conversation, other people won't be able to understand what you want. Therefore, to become a real love killer, psychologists have diligently researched and found the following little secrets: first, start the story naturally, second. 2, 5 - 10 minutes is a suitable communication time, easy to create a feeling of closeness that makes the other person curious about you. A 2003 study in the US showed the fact that men often fall into a dream state when flirting with girls. Psychological research on love shows that men's sexual orientation is higher than that of women, so boys often think that the other girl likes them, loves them at first sight. However, in reality, girls may just be a little bit ""in love"" or have no feelings for the guy at all. According to research by psychologist and love expert Monica Moore of Webster University, the key to successful flirting is communication skills, not good looks. Specifically, he studied human flirting behavior in bars or shopping malls - where young people often hang out. Through the analysis, he concluded that people who know how to use smiles and eye contact skills are rated higher than those who are simply attractive in appearance. Research has also shown that a sustained two-minute look and a slow smile can increase feelings of love and passion in a romantic relationship. Eye contact is not only an important cue when flirting, but it's also surprisingly effective.

Wish you always happy with the people you love. \",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2.0,loss aversion,loss avers,"The Loss aversion effect was studied by psychologist Daniel Kahneman in 1979. This study of the Loss aversion effect wants to point out one thing: The effect of Loss aversion. The reaction happens when you don't want to lose what you have. The illustration shows that people are always afraid of losing and clinging to things that have been lost. The study took place where study participants were given cups, chocolates, or nothing at all. There are 2 options for them: One, if they already own the mug or chocolate, they can exchange the other; Second, if they receive nothing, they can choose one of the two options above. Results: Those who had nothing chose the cup most of the time, and more than 85% of those who received the cup at first did not change at all. This shows that people don't want to lose what they already have, even if they have a choice. The effect of loss aversion is also influenced by an attribute called ""instant gratification"". These are two distinct but closely related effects. For example: With events that are entertaining and bring joy such as going out, going to the movies, watching concerts, etc., our reaction is always to expect those events to happen quickly or immediately. instantly. as immediately as possible. But with the things that we consider to be difficult such as doing homework, going to group meetings, going to school... we just hope that something unexpected happens so that homework, going to school, etc. won't happen or be delayed. happy no. That is, if there is something that can repel sadness, fear and make us feel safe, then we are always ready to do it. It also explains why people buy insurance for themselves and expensive things (such as cars, houses), couples rush to combine for fear of long-term love will get married. one day love will fade and the boy or girl will leave another person… Insurance policies, marriage certificates are proof that our fear of loss will disappear. If there is $50, most people choose to keep it rather than invest or gamble.

5.0,clustering effect,cluster effect,"Clustering effect, English name is Clustering, was discovered by MacQueen in 1967. In the human brain, the space to remember a lot of data is very limited. Normally, most people can only remember 7 different pieces of information (maybe less or more than 2 pieces of information) at a given time. Clustering is how people group related information to make it easier to remember. There are two methods to cluster data: Hierarchical Clustering and Hierarchical Clustering. Hierarchical clustering is done in two directions: Integration or Split. Aggregate hierarchical clustering is grouping separate messages together into a group of related information. Hierarchical information grouping is a grouping that starts from a single group of information into separate subgroups until each information is a separate group. Non-hierarchical clustering, also known as K-method clustering, has three methods to perform clustering: Sequential Threshold, Parallel Clustering, and Parallel Clustering. Threshold), Optimize partition. Clustering starts sequentially from selecting a cluster of information first, then other clusters with similarity will be merged into this cluster. Parallel start clustering is performed similarly to sequential start clustering, but cluster selection and clustering are performed in parallel. Optimal clustering differs from two ways of point-based clustering: Clusters after being merged into a certain information cluster can still be merged into another information cluster if the minimum criteria are satisfied. Synchronize data. Clustering effect is applied to many activities and areas of life. When going to the supermarket, instead of memorizing individual items such as coffee, laundry detergent, dishwashing liquid, meat, fish, etc., you will group them into groups such as Drinks, Spices, Food, Household items. … When designing a supermarket website about food, you can divide related information or content into groups, for example, group by author's name, group by food area...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5.0,asperger's syndrome - asperger's syndrome,asperg syndrom asperg syndrom,"Asperger's syndrome is one of the syndromes with a very high incidence. Children On average, 1 out of every 100 newborns will have this condition. Children with this disease often have superior intelligence and thinking, so no one thinks that it is also a symptom of the disease. Asperger's syndrome, specifically Asperger's Syndrome, was discovered and studied by Austrian pediatrician Hans Asperger in 1944. He showed that people with this disease have normal intelligence and development. . However, having autism reduces the ability to communicate in normal society. The exact cause of this disease is still unclear. But it can be generalized that it is formed by the biological psychology of the patient. People with Asperger's syndrome live as normal people. They even have sharper minds than others. However, they have many manifestations of people with neurological disorders leading to impairment and poor communication skills. They like to be alone. They are always erratic. Their intellectual thinking can be superior. However, the ability to communicate, convey and understand the meaning of other people's sentences is extremely slow. They can speak extremely quickly the same content they like. But extremely slow in solving and understanding other people's sentences. Specifically, people with Asperger's syndrome will be very agitated and psychotic of autism. The patient's sense of smell and taste are extremely sensitive. Easily frightened by light and sound. And they are easy to become the object of being teased by others. This leads to the stimulation of extreme protest behaviour. Asperger's syndrome is difficult to detect, only when the child goes to school and is reflected by the teacher about the child's developmental delay, then take the child to the doctor. Therefore, therapies that directly intervene in the disease state take time. Social skills training and speech therapy are the best courses to use.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5.0,text effect,text effect,"The verbatim effect is understood according to the following principle. As people tend to remember the general ideas that the content contains rather than remember the extra details surrounding it. Because this will help users remember the core issues they care about. Instead of memorizing supporting details, it's easy to forget the main content. That is also the core problem of this psychological effect. This effect is used for marketing purposes. So why does this field need to do well with this psychological effect? Currently, to be able to give information to users. What is the core content you need to present? To do that requires communication in the title. Must express enough ideas, concise, easy for readers to understand. In particular, they can get information more easily. So, smart and flexible use of verbatim effects will make it easier to convey meaning and content. That requires a very important title choice. It needs to encapsulate the content you want to convey inside the article. The time the reader spends on the page is usually very short. Therefore, if the content you convey is not attractive enough and there is no central content to capture the information, very few people will be able to understand what the content you want to mention is? Therefore, it is necessary to create attraction and highlight the content right from the title. That's the smartest way that marketers need to know to apply. More than just making it easier to find and share. It also makes content more accessible to readers. Stimulate them to want to see more content details if they feel it is useful information they need. It's also a way to extend the time users stay on your site. This verbatim effect should be applied most flexibly in the field of marketing. Especially when you apply it thoroughly with good and useful content. Your article will be ranked high on google. Your information will appear in the results table that google provides to users.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2.0,fear makes us stronger,fear make stronger,"It all starts with understanding. You have to understand fear to be able to manipulate it. You can make it work for you: provide light for you when you are in the dark and generate energy. On the contrary, let it get out of control and it can hurt you, even kill you. . . Fear is the friend of special people. According to the advice of legendary boxing coach Cus D'Amato, fear is not something we should hide or ignore. It's a tool - fear makes us stronger. And like all tools, we just need to understand how to use it. Steven Pressfield reinforces in his book how resistance breaks down creative barriers, in his words: “Fear is a good thing. Like self-doubt, fear is a red flag. From there fear tells us what to do. Resistance is an experience, the level of fear equals the strength of resistance. Therefore, the more fearful we feel about a particular business, the more certain we are that that business is important to us and the growth of our company. “We are constantly talking about conquering our fears. As if the enemy had to pass. Think about that for a minute. Whether we are afraid or not is a survival instinct that we have developed over thousands of years to keep us safe. And we want to prevent that? And treat it like an enemy? Is this really the best use of this tool? What if we chose to understand fear instead? And let it be a contributing tool – fear makes us stronger, rather than just an obstacle. For example, the fear of the sudden appearance of predators is no longer relevant to modern cities. Fear becomes irrational with fear of ghosts and demons. It's an instinctive emotion, based on evolution. However, those who are quick to react to fear often outlive their unhappy neighbors, who must consider the meaning behind the approaching tiger. Like most people are afraid of airplanes, so they all understand the importance of safety on the plane. So, with thousands of evolutionary studies going on, how do we manage fear to make us stronger? By treating it like we were, are and will be anyone else. “Your ultimate goal as a parent is not to win any war one way or another, but to win your child's love and respect throughout life. .” – Harvey Karp, Happiest Kid in the Block. There's no better definition of the emotional outburst that describes a upset two-year-old. Every parent knows that a frustrated child can be creative within seconds. When you reverse the transition from happiness to anger, they transform into the definition of absurdity and leave an awakening of destruction on their path to adulthood. In Harvey Karp's specific guide to successfully working through these stressful times, he suggests that what our children really need is not a solution, but simply being heard. Children want us to acknowledge their feelings. They want to see that we understand. In his words, “Remember, there is a huge difference between feeling angry and acting angry. You must prevent misbehavior, but it's important that your child knows that you understand how they feel and that you care, even if you disagree. “In this situation, when we are sad, we do not always need a solution. Many times we just need someone to listen, understand and confirm their concerns with us. When people feel heard, they feel valued. And everyone wants to feel valued. As Bryant H. McGill said: “One of the most sincere forms of respect is listening to what others have to say.” Fear is no exception. It wants the same thing that we all do. It must be seen, heard, considered and appreciated. “Fear means feeling uncomfortable. That's how it got noticed. ""- Kristen Ulmer. For years, I treated fear like a child. I suppressed that inner voice, never really listening to it. Imagine having a well-meaning employee. but every offer is blocked or ignored. That is my relationship with fear. Every time the voice of fear rises in me, I will suppress it. I will ignore it. And in doing so it will scream louder and louder I refuse to acknowledge that voice And just like refuse to acknowledge other people's concerns, this behavior keeps me from seeing the message behind it fear words that's all fear really wants But only when we listen to it The great philosopher, scientist and mathematician René Descartes argued for the need to strike a balance between hope and fear to avoid numbness. smug and complacent. nature changes and it becomes complacent. And when we know for sure that what we want will pass, even if we want it to pass, we are no longer provoked by lustful passions. Or in the words of Pema Chodrin, ""If you don't know the nature of fear, you can never be without fear."" Let fear make us stronger. ""Hero and coward both feel the same, but the hero uses his fear to take down his opponent, while the coward runs away."" Cus D'Amato After the 2014 TED conference, in which Neil Gaiman read a ghost story and discussed why these stories affect us so strongly, he discussed the importance of grief. fear in every aspect of literature, “For stories to work – for children and adults – they would be terrifying. And you want to win. There is no point in conquering evil if evil is not feared. And just as victory over a dull evil wouldn't be inspiring enough, our victories and achievements would lose meaning without the fear behind them. Fear provides the overcoming from which to achieve worthwhile achievement. It forces us to try harder and confront our own limitations to become a better version of ourselves. Fear not, we have no resistance. And without resistance, there would be no growth. So take some time. Realize what our fears are. A voice is trying to help. And treat it with respect and consider that it deserves. Because that's all it really wants. And once understood, fear makes us stronger.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2.0,tips to make journaling more enjoyable,tip journal enjoy,"When it comes to ""diary writing"", many people will immediately think of the pink diaries of teenage boys and girls. But have you ever thought that ""journaling"" is an extremely useful and interesting method of taking care of the soul that anyone can use. In the introduction to the topic Writing Regularly – Caring for Your Soul: Discover 6 Amazing Benefits of Daily Journaling, we introduced you to the most basic benefits of journaling . Write actions for each person's mental health. Realizing the flood of information in today's modern society, we believe more and more in the thesis: There needs to be a method to help people calm down to look deeper into themselves and about life. around. Unable to lie still, drifting with the flood of desires, wishes, and struggles, people will never find good sleep, light and relaxing moments again. With this starting point, we realize that writing can be an effective tool to help us humans find some inner peace. In order to help readers have more suggestions to put the ""writing"" activity into their real life, we would like to try to collect and synthesize everyone's good and useful experiences and sharing. regularly practice journaling around the world. It is hoped that these anthologies will help readers discover and begin to practice a new approach to mental health care. In today's article, we would like to introduce to you the experience of author CM Smith of Life Hack site. He has been keeping a diary for 5 years now. Smith summarized 6 writing methods that helped him change himself for the better through this activity. When we start something new, we tend to do it with great enthusiasm. But when the first time passes, enthusiasm wanes and it is easy to give up on the activity that has begun. To prevent this from happening, Smith suggests, we'll try to take a closer look at what can actually happen when you're journaling. Chances are, with a thorough understanding of journaling and its benefits, you'll be motivated to make it an activity to practice daily. In short, Smith says, journaling is the most ""free"" experience he's ever had. Every time he sits down with a notebook and pen, it's an opportunity for him to slow down, calmly think about the problems around him as well as think about himself. Here are six writing methods Smith has used over the course of five years to practice journaling daily. Each method gives you its own effect. Smith found that in this day and age, we tend to run after external things and forget about our connections to the inner world. Those connections manifest in the form of emotions (negative and positive). Keeping ourselves busy to accomplish our goals for a long time will cause us to fall into a state of mental ""fatigue"". That's why Smith turned the space in his diary into a place for him to honestly and honestly acknowledge the emotions that were affecting him. Recording these feelings (especially when they are high-level: too sad, or too happy) will help you objectively reflect on how you feel. From there, realize which factors in your life are affecting your emotional change. This understanding will help you to better manage your emotional outbursts in later situations. For example, when you detail your feelings of depression, along with the telltale signs—situations that make you feel like your actions are losing meaning. It is certain that as these signals continue to appear in your life, you will quickly recognize and find ways to overcome them, thereby reducing the intensity or duration of the depressed state. ""For Smith, journaling is a great opportunity for him to calmly reflect on his perspective and way of thinking in a certain situation. Because usually, in life, when an event happens, we we often get carried away by external factors and internal feelings because then they can't clearly see how they think and act in that situation. Seeing yourself in that situation helps you to find out. the limitations of your vision and the shortcomings of your behavior.Also, journaling time with Smith is ideal for trying to figure out.There is no better place than a diary for you to learn to put yourself in. This is also the starting point for others to understand and sympathize with."" Here's Smith's third suggestion to help you feel the joy of journaling. Smith shares that when he cultivates this mindset, he finds writing down what happens to him every day more joyful, pleasurable, and inspiring. He also shared, if you try to patiently record your life for a long enough time (1-3 months), you will be surprised when you read it again. The life you have lived is much more interesting and profound than you think. Smith shared, he always thought he understood himself very well. He knows what he likes, what he hates and his limitations. However, after a while of journaling, he realized that what he knew about himself was not as complete and complete as he thought. Smith discovered many of his deepest dreams, as well as those that he couldn't stand. These new findings give Smith extra motivation. With things that make him uncomfortable, Smith will create new limits for himself. Something that pisses me off, I probably shouldn't do to other people. ""To get more excited about journaling, Smith offers this advice to everyone: Use journaling as a means and opportunity for you to connect with family, old friends, even friends. He said he had always wished that his grandfather or grandmother could leave him such a diary.He felt that the diary pages would create a deep spiritual connection. between generations, or between him and those who will read what he writes."" Back to the first suggestion: When we write about our feelings, we tend to consider whether it's a good feeling? But Smith discourages you from doing this. He suggests using journaling as an opportunity to practice honesty, first with yourself. Therefore, don't hesitate to write down all the negative emotions like jealousy, anger and struggle that you have on paper. After putting all your emotions into the notebook, calmly look at them all as an outsider, to understand that those negative emotions really exist in you. However, remember, these negatives are not all about who you are.

The degree of jealousy of each person is different because each person's possessiveness is different. It can be the sweet spice for love but also a double-edged sword that can destroy a good love. French psychologists have retreated from holding seminars to research and discuss why guys are jealous. They concluded that the boys' jealousy stemmed from being too in love, because of lack of confidence, because of infidelity, or from the other half when the object was superior to them in many aspects or because of the desire of women. . The simplest explanation for boys' jealousy is that they love each other too much. When giving love to each other, they also expect the other to love and care only for themselves. A boy's possessiveness is stimulated and aroused when his woman is interested in others. When they feel that the other person is superior to them in many ways, many people feel that their pride is being trampled along with the fear that the other person may be attracted to another talented person.

2.0,words and pain,word pain,"simple word can bring hurt, a sincere statement is enough to warm the cold winter. There are times when we think ""Words are flying"" and it won't be a big deal if we accidentally speak badly of someone. I even think an apology is enough to show my sincerity. ""I have a very kind friend. She is usually concerned about others and is always willing to help those in difficulty, even new acquaintances. However, she is not liked by many people, because she is not liked by many people. she often cares about someone when she is sad but her friends often don't want to share, because she often talks more than listens, she also jokes or talks too much. "", ""Why did you buy this suit. Expensive but nothing outstanding?"", ""Delicious wine drinks forever, wise people talk a lot, even if it's good, it's boring"". Although everyone knew my friend was honest by nature, because she was clumsy and often didn't care what other people thought, no one felt comfortable talking to her. Just like the old saying: ""Good wine is never boring, but a wise person is bored no matter how good it is"". It is true that there are things we are better off not saying. Especially when speaking out, we often impose our views on others, but rarely stand in their position to consider the problem. Parents are impatient because their children are single, urging them to get married. Divorced people think that marriage is just a fake, a grave of love, should not enter. People who have gone to work see those who continue to study for a master's or doctorate as a waste of time. Entrepreneurs find that employees are selling their souls to others. The person who bought the house urged others to buy a house at all costs… You are enjoying a delicious cake, immediately someone comes to you and keeps saying sweets gain weight; On weekends, if you are interested in going to the library to read books, someone advises you to go out and exercise; You want to go to the beach, so someone complains about going to the beach. Although they also want to be nice to you, those words are easy to lose affection. But then, are those ""concerned"" words any different from the random sentences of strangers? We often do, and most of them do: use our own experiences to give advice to others, or worse still, try to change them to our liking. When successful, people say admired, praised; and when their choice is wrong, people share to hope to find sympathy and agreement. Although people always preach with their mouths that they don't care what other people think, but everyone's heart will sometimes be soft and shaken by the words of others. They seem fine on the outside, still trying to smile, but inside they hurt like a thousand knives. So when you're in a bad mood, slow down or don't say anything at all. Language is invisible, but its damage is not small.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2.0,common misunderstandings about loneliness,common misunderstand loneli,"Loneliness is now considered an epidemic of modern times. But the disease is getting worse? At some point in our lives, we may feel lonely. This is an issue that has been covered a lot in the media. In the UK, there is even a new position in the government as Deputy Minister in charge of solitude, in charge of coordinating with ministries and branches to handle and solve problems. This is an important topic, causing much unhappiness. However, there is quite a bit of arrhythmic speculation about it. Here are five of the most common misconceptions people make when it comes to loneliness. ""The feeling of loneliness is not the same as feeling alone, alone. Loneliness is the feeling of being isolated, having no connection with others. This is a psychological state where no one is really around. understand you and you don't have a relationship that means a lot to you."" Loneliness can be one factor that makes you feel lonely, but it's not the only factor. You can feel lonely even in the midst of a crowd, just as you can feel completely happy, content, even comfortable when there are times when you are alone, with no one to disturb you. edge edge. When the BBC conducted the 2016 Rest Test, the five most common rest activities were those done alone. Sometimes we want to be alone. But if we do not have the conditions to share free time, relax with people who understand us, that is when the lonely mood will appear. Loneliness is clearly a growing problem, but that doesn't mean more people feel lonely today than they did a few years ago. Based on studies conducted since 1948, Christina Victor from Brunel University has shown that the percentage of elderly people experiencing chronic loneliness has remained stable over the past 70 years, with 6-13% saying they feel lonely most of the time. The actual number of people suffering from this mood has increased simply because the world is now more crowded than before. Loneliness makes people sad. But the good news here is that it is only a temporary state and should not always be viewed negatively. Instead, it could be a sign that we're looking for new friends or looking to improve on existing ones. Neuroscientist and social scientist, John Cacioppo, argues that we evolved to experience loneliness in order to help us maintain relationships with others. He compares this to thirst. If you feel thirsty, you will find water to drink. If you feel lonely, you will find someone else. For thousands of years, humanity has been safe because we exist in groups, so the need to survive leads us to find ways to build relationships with each other. While loneliness is often a temporary state of mind, if it becomes chronic, the consequences can be very serious. There is convincing evidence that it can impair health, affect sleep quality, and lead to sadness. It can also lead to a false cycle where lonely people withdraw from social activities, making them feel even more alone. The results of the study showed that if a person feels lonely, the risk of that person developing depressive symptoms a year later is higher. This problem is somewhat more complicated. We often see data cited on the effects of loneliness on people's health. A review of the results of this study found that loneliness can increase the risk of heart disease and stroke by almost a third; Lonely people suffer from high blood pressure and lower life expectancy. These are serious results, but there are many cross-sectional studies so we can't say for sure. It is possible that isolated, unhappy people are more likely to get sick. But it can also be the other way around. People can become isolated and lonely because they already have poor health, which is why they don't have social interactions. Or lonely people may be highlighted more often in metrics like being less healthy than other groups because loneliness makes them less motivated to take care of their own health. And of course it doesn't necessarily lead to one state of another, but it can be a reciprocal two-way state. Loneliness is more common in old age than in adults, but in studying loneliness, Pamela Qualter from the University of Manchester found that it also occurs at certain times in youth. Besides, there are studies that show that 50-60% of elderly people do not often feel lonely.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2.0,explaining human behavior,explain human behavior,"Let's explore behavioral explanations from different angles in the world of human behavioral psychology to see how exciting behavioral science can be! Behavior is essentially a goal-directed activity, motivated by the desire to achieve a certain goal. The reason lies in the fact that, not always each individual has a sense of purpose. Surely not once did you ask yourself “Why am I doing this”? The reason is that people's psychology and behavior are not always clear in their heads, and what they need is a certain ""motivation"". “Motivation” plays a role in driving subconscious behaviors or behavioral needs that are complex, multi-layered, and broad. The basic unit of behavior is activity. The whole human behavior is a sequence of actions, for example: walking, talking, eating, sleeping, working... Humans can also perform many actions at the same time such as driving while listening to music/ talking on the phone, typing while answering if someone calls you… More importantly, at any time we can change our actions or combinations of actions and start doing something else. This raises a question: Why do we do this and not that? The most satisfactory answer is based on the psychology of human behavior. The choice of ""engine"" for implementation is actually a complex and logical psychological mechanism that has been invested and studied for many years. All the physical structures that make up our bodies make a fundamental contribution to human behavior. From inorganic minerals, organic matter, cells, genes (genetic characteristics) located in those cells, to systems that ensure the functioning of the body such as the nervous system and organs. Other systems such as the circulatory system, the digestive system, etc. Just lack of one of these material components, human behavior and consciousness will be significantly affected. For example, iron-deficient children's food leads to mental retardation. Human psychology is closely related to the surrounding world. The environment we live in sends us countless signals. And among them, there are signals that are conscious, but there are also signals that are not conscious. The leading environmental factors influencing behavior include school and family upbringing, social institutions, culture, religion, environment in which people are born and raised, etc. The example of environmental impact is very clear. Children who grow up in slums are more likely to commit crimes than children who live in well-educated environments. As analyzed above, human behavior is motivated by ""motivation"", and imagination is a kind of conscious or unconscious ""motivation"". A set of past behaviors of a person capable of determining that person's behavior in the present and in the future. Many cases have been proven by human behavioral psychologists such as lying, lying about relevant facts or increasing the frequency of lying all stemming from behavior. harmless lies. The mind consists of three parts: conscious, subconscious and unconscious. Consciousness can be attached to what has been said above. Consciousness can arise from biological reactions, within our own bodies (e.g. perimenopausal psychology, postpartum depression, etc.). Consciousness, on the other hand, is directly and deeply affected by the external environment. Most prominently, a person's psychology and sense of behavior are often expressed through the concept of ""responsibility"". Responsibility can be regulated by the society itself, where people exist and develop. Therefore, behavior is controlled by society and tends to follow these conventions. On the other hand, people are not only bound by ordinary responsibilities, but also impose on themselves psychological and ethical responsibilities that are observed from the surrounding environment. This can be called the ""conscience"" factor in dealing with people. Behaviors, or rather sequences of actions, will take place every day, every hour for humans to operate the brain to think and process different ""machines"". Therefore, human behavioral psychology is very interested in detecting and controlling abnormal behaviors. Based on the factors affecting behavior, scientists can develop drugs to control excessive human behavior or help solve psychological diseases such as depression, autism... In addition, Detecting and controlling behavior is also one of the things that we ourselves should grasp and practice to avoid encountering unwanted situations in life. Finally, no one can't help but admit, the psychology of dealing with people is indeed complicated but also very close and practical!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1.0,generalized anxiety disorder (gad),gener anxieti disord gad,"Generalized anxiety disorder refers to people with excessive levels of anxiety. For us, the problem of worrying about food, clothes, and money is a common concern. But when that simple anxiety is raised to another level, it becomes an illness. Generalized anxiety disorder is also known as Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). This syndrome refers to people with extreme anxiety. The way they worry and think about their worries is very different from the average person. They naturally wake up and worry about something for no apparent reason. And they just live in that anxious thought and ignore all living activities around. The cause of this generalized anxiety disorder has been concluded by psychologists that it can be caused by both physiological and psychological problems. People with generalized anxiety disorder begin to miss out on everyday worries. One such relatively common worry is money. But if it is still a worry of ordinary people, they will think of ways to solve that worry with action. Or that anxiety is only present for a certain period of time. So for people with GAD, same problem. They won't stop thinking. Can't turn it into action. It exists only in the mind. People are not interested in living activities around. Keep your mind in a state of extreme stress. GAD causes people to often lose sleep because of unreasonable worries. Mental breakdown. It is not possible to build your own worldview. Especially not being able to completely solve a problem. No matter how simple the problem is. They are very easily startled because their nerves are always tense. And it is very difficult for them to find themselves a quiet place. It requires the cooperation, guidance and regulation of psychologists. They will guide and give appropriate treatment for each subject when suffering from a comprehensive anxiety disorder syndrome. It is important to create a suitable space for the patient to rest and relax. Avoid letting them interact and solve problems alone.

1.0,what is behavioral psychology?,behavior psycholog,"While modern psychology is getting closer and closer to everyone, it is time for us to delve into each school of psychology more deeply. So what is the school of behavioral psychology? To answer the above question, behavioral psychology, also known as behavioral theory, is known as a theory based on the view that every behavior can be learned with conditions. actualization) occurs through the object's interactions with the environment. Behavioral psychologists believe that a person's response to environmental stimuli is what drives behavior. Behaviors can be systematically learned and clearly observed from the outside without going into deep psychological happenings. Basically, people only consider behaviors that are observable to the naked eye. According to John B. Watson, who is considered the ""father"" of behavioral theory, summarized the content of this theory in his analysis entitled ""Psychology as the Behaviorist Views It"". Behavioral Psychology) 1993: Simply put, purely behavioral psychologists believe that all behavior is the result of experience. Anyone, regardless of their educational background, can be trained in some way with the right conditions of impact. If you are still confused about what behavioral psychology is after reading the lengthy concepts above, then to summarize, behavioral psychology (behavior theory) consists of two main types of conditions. classical conditioning and conditioning from the result. The first type works by developing an association between an environmental stimulus and a naturally occurring stimulus. When an association disappears, also known as the quenching phase, it weakens or disappears. Factors such as the magnitude of the initial reaction can play an important role in determining how quickly the bond disappears. Going forward, the consolidation timeframe is very important. This process is as simple as observing a behavior and then giving an appropriate reward and punishment, maintained for a certain period of time. Behavioral psychology is based on observable behaviors, so it can be applied to psychotherapy. Effective treatment techniques such as behavioral interventions, behavioral analysis, economic rewards, and discrete training are all rooted in behavioral theory. One of the benefits of behaviorism is that it allows scientists to examine observed behaviors systematically and scientifically. However, many consider it incomplete because it does not take into account several important behavioral influences. It can be said that the biggest contribution of behavioral psychology lies in its practical applicability. Ordinary people who do not yet know what behavioral psychology is can still receive guidance from doctors and specialists to correct problem behaviors and encourage more positive and beneficial behaviors. In addition to psychology, parents, teachers, animal trainers, and many others can use the fundamentals of behavioral psychology to help train new and restrictive positive behaviors. prevent unwanted behavior. However, behavioral theory also has certain limitations. Many critics argue that this is a one-way approach to understanding human behavior and that behavioral theories do not address free will and intrinsic influences such as moods, thoughts, and emotions. As Freud said, behaviorism fails because it fails to express the child's thoughts, feelings, and desires in an unconscious state of mind, even though all of these still influence behavior. of human. Other thinkers, such as Carl Rogers and other humanistic psychologists, believe that behaviorism is too rigid and restrictive, not taking into account individual factors. This is also one of the reasons why behavioral psychology research has been less appealing for many years now. Although behavioral theory no longer holds the dominant position as in the past, it still has a great impact on understanding human psychology, helping humanity discover themselves from the beginning. inside and from there find the most suitable modes of existence.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since then, the butcher's behavior has become mixed, sometimes vulgar, sometimes elegant. In fact, at present, multiple personality disorder is controversial in the research of many scientists and has many unexplained factors. According to research by the American Psychiatric Association, DID is the existence of two or more identities or personalities in a person, where each identity or personality has a perception. Consciousness, association, and thinking about the environment or the individual themselves constantly control behavior. Then DID will lead to patients with similar psychological symptoms that are very different in each patient. And the specific symptoms of dissociative identity disorder (DID) are: – There are at least two human identities in the patient's mind that can dominate multiple behaviors continuously and uncontrollably. Alright. - The phenomenon of episodic amnesia in patients, which means that sometimes the patient remembers his behavior very clearly, but sometimes does not remember that behavior. And this is repeated. - Symptoms appear temporarily and then disappear without clear cause due to the use of drugs or chemicals.

One of the current treatments to reduce delusions in the patient's thoughts is hypnosis, suggestion and imagination stimulation. The duration of the treatment course is within 4 years and it is very difficult to fully recover. Dissociative identity disorder (DID) has a treatment method, but it is extremely complex, so it needs social attention and further research into the behavior and expression of the patient. .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In many cases, when you can't control your emotions or disagree with an issue, you can quickly make inaccurate and ambiguous decisions, explains Lynda Klau. Therefore, you should absolutely not make any choices when you can't control it. In that moment, you might think it was the right decision. However, when you calm down and think again, you will realize that it was not the final wise decision. “If you have to make a big life decision, give yourself plenty of time to think and question yourself. What will you get and how much will you pay for that decision? And is that choice really necessary in your life? In particular, it is this thinking process that will help you form reactions and quick thinking when you have to solve similar problems in life”, emphasized Dr. Lynda Klau.

The proven effect is that too much stimulation, for a long time, too strong stimulation will make the psychology extremely uncomfortable and tend to resist. Anyone under the influence of such a large stimulus will be affected by this psychological effect. It was discovered that this effect is from the story of the famous American author Mark Twain.

However, many people never take the time to think about their personality traits. Knowing your own personality will help you find your strengths and weaknesses, and help you understand how others are. Most modern psychologists agree that there are five main personality types, known as the ""five-factor model,"" and that everyone possesses some of these traits. People who score high on this trait are often productive, well-organized, reliable, and independent. They like to plan everything in advance and set very high goals. People with few of these traits are often considered unruly. Trivia: Research shows that marrying thoughtful people increases your chances of success in the workplace.

Research shows that men who hold hands tightly when shaking hands are more outgoing and alert. However, this is not true for women. People with a high ""friendly"" index are trustworthy, kind, and kind to others. They often participate in volunteer and community activities. Many consider them naive and too passive. Trivia: Look for a high-index financial investor. Research shows that friendly investors are the ones who lose the least money on risky trades.

They prefer to pursue self-affirmation through intense, exhilarating experiences, such as meditation or living abroad. Others may consider them unpredictable and unfocused.

Research shows that open people are not afraid to express their political beliefs and are very fond of liberal ideas. These people often experience high levels of emotional instability. They are very sensitive, easily excitable, and very susceptible to unpleasant emotions such as anxiety and irritability. Others find them wavering and insecure.

2.0,should you be honest when you love?,honest love,"There is a Confession page of a fairly famous university outside of Hanoi that specializes in posting smooth, unfinished and tragic love stories just like Korean movies. Every time I go there, after reading the lamenting articles of most guys, I wonder, what is the mentality of a girl when she truly loves? My post title is the opposite of my intro. I ask myself about the sincerity of girls when it comes to love as a woman, and also from my own experience, I advise girls not to be sincere in love. In fact, we always have more than one way of defining a term. Except for scientific words that require precision, other emotional phrases will probably be defined by countless people. Because language also reflects the human soul. Honest or dishonest? So what is the first truth? Answering this question with a convincing definition will answer the question from the very beginning: what is the mentality of a girl when she truly loves? Honestly, I think when we treat others with honesty, without self-interest and without hiding anything, even our vices, including our courage. , the heart is also displayed on the banquet table with generous hearts without distance. And in my opinion this is not good. In fact, good or bad is only a relative matter and cannot be measured or analyzed to the end. To argue why I assign a term to slightly negative emotions, you must first be in my situation, then make a decision. That is also the way to lead: ""Here I would like to tell a story related to the topic of girls' psychology when truly in love"". I was in the same class as a couple who had been in love since middle school. Later, when they went to high school, they both attended different schools, had different future orientations, and many conflicts arose, so they broke up (for the first time). After entering a famous school in the city, he met many more beautiful beauties (because my old friend at school was also famous for being beautiful, so at that time the couple was like a man and a woman). , then flirt with a girl and then the two break up again (for the second time). After that, the two continued to divide up and down a few dozen times (a bit much) and then he went to study in this country, she married another country. So far apart. That friend I don't play with anymore, but the other girl is still my best friend and this is the time when a girl's mentality when in true love has to suffer all because of those two ""truly"" words. I don't know what they swear to each other when they love each other, but when it comes to girls, once they're sincere, they'll dig out everything, it's stupid. Stupid enough to break up and still come back just because my heart can't stand it. Then believe the people who promise deer promise gibbons, sometimes they are honest with you. It turned out to be a vicious cycle, trapping oneself in pain. To this day, my friend still can't forget her first boyfriend. Everything was very real to each other, thought they knew all about each other, but it turned out to be unsuccessful, both still went their separate ways. If I say I'm a bit tragic about the truth, it's not just putting all my efforts into one person but failing, feeling that the love I give is too much but the return is meager. Will I still be loved like this in the future? The girls have really fallen into the girl's mentality when they truly love but love without suffering! I do not advise girls to live a lie. I just advise girls not to take it too seriously. I was 100% honest from the start, like I was showing them that I love more – and I lost the gamble! Only being honest with how you feel will people respect you more, understand you better, but expose in front of viewers even your secret confidants when you are not really sure, the real person will is your girlfriend. . That's true, but a truly emotional woman is much more painful than having her favorite dress torn or a million dong lipstick broken. That is a warning. If I use the word honesty, I'm afraid it goes too far into the moral aspect! Because inherently in modern life, knowing how to protect yourself, keeping three parts secret for yourself is still much better. Moreover, a girl's mentality when it comes to true love is not too defensive, but trusting someone - even a lover - should still take time and challenges. So I suggest the word ""mind"". Use your heart to treat your heart. People who are good to me are good to me, good to me are good to me, sometimes generously giving up another part or two for precious harmony, avoiding revealing weak feelings and heartache later. Actually, re-reading the post I shared is also really pessimistic, but women who are born disadvantaged should be more alert and avoid revealing indiscriminately.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Love is when you want to be with that person day and night, want to know what his life is like. Love is when you want to give all the best to the other person, is when you can endure hunger to share for the other person to the last bite. Love is when your world is already full of colors and relationships, but you always remember only one face. There are many ways to define love, but in the end, they are just different expressions of a sacred, intense, sweet and painful feeling. According to basic love psychology, love has 5 stages, but many couples give up halfway through stage 3. Let's explore what those 5 stages are. Falling in love is a wonderful feeling indeed. At this time, your body is flooded with the love hormone oxytocin, the happiness hormone – dopamine, the “intoxicating” chemical serotonin, the hormones testosterone and estrogen. When you start to develop feelings for the other person, the world inside you changes every day and becomes a little happier. When we first fall in love, we anxiously look forward to their call, yearn for physical contact, and love all their attributes. This is always the most beautiful, most romantic stage. You're almost looking at the relationship at this stage through rose-colored glasses. And who knows, you consider that person to be the other half of your life. Basic love psychology holds that, after a few months or years together, the happiness that love brings will gradually fade. It really is a natural cycle of EVERY love relationship. Over time, phone calls become annoying, intimate contact isn't as expected and welcome as it once was, and other people's flaws—things you used to feel fine about. , now become the things that bother you.

At these times, we or they often start asking ourselves questions like “Is this the person I really love/need?”, “Is this how I started this relationship? wrong?”… And the common tendency is that we yearn to experience those special and beautiful emotions again with another person. In fact, this is where the relationship goes downhill. Many couples stop at this stage, when their love is not deep enough to go through the tumultuous days together. And they can't go together to the next stage of love. Basic love psychology researchers suggest that when two people work together through difficult times when trust is not complete, the relationship will become stronger than ever. At this stage, you will know how to appreciate the other person's efforts more, be more patient and tolerant to forgive their mistakes, because they are the person you can't let go of even if there are times when the two of you can't. can be separated from each other. no longer trust each other. Some say love is not two people looking at each other, but holding hands and looking in the same direction, striving for a common future. The challenges in love that two people have overcome together are the ""golden test fire"", and the relationship at this stage will be very difficult to crack. However, this is the end not every couple has. Hopefully, through this article, you have learned what you need to know about the basic psychology of love, and remember: love is never a one-sided affair. Starting, maintaining, and mending a relationship takes effort on both sides. To love long, you must cherish love every day, and do not let go while your heart is still in love. This life may bring us people we don't get to choose, but we can, by the promptings of our hearts, choose who to be with. May you always be happy with your heart's choice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2.0,"serious story, sage story | girl mentality when in love",stori sage stori girl mental love,"When I was in college, I used to study Chinese with my two girlfriends when I was close to the exam. The special feature of this trio is that I am the one who picks up the book and listens to the other two's lectures. What's even more special is that they both have lovers. Except me. In fact, there are dozens of girls in the college class and every semester, one girl has a lover. Just like that, until graduation, I was happy alone. Back to the group study story above. The so-called ""group study"" actually exists literally only in the movies, but there is no such thing as ""group study"" in real life! The textbook is beautifully presented, the paper and pen are white after a few hours of light. The girls' ""group study"" actually consisted of snacks, milk tea and small talk. And the girls in love have a new ""repertory"": discussing… lovers. That's how I know when girls love or say sublime words! Their vocabulary has grown tremendously after just a few notes, often the opening sentence is: ""And my brother is..."" But when girls fall in love, they keep whispering about each other. the story of the lover who is indifferent, the story of the lover who is busy playing games, the story of the lover who likes a girl's photo on facebook... is how many memories overflow, one story after another, with no end. That day, while studying in a group, a female friend temporarily called Miss A (because it was not convenient to reveal her identity) asked me about the yearbook shooting schedule. Because I didn't take pictures with the whole class, but just stopped to take pictures with these two girls, I was also wondering if I should come early or close to noon. Immediately, Miss B (also an unidentified girl) said that you should go past noon and that my brother wanted to eat us all, let's say… debut! Wow, how attractive is the word ""eaten craving"". But for those who already have a lover, especially with a girl's mentality when in love, the ""debut"" part, first of all making friends, is much more important! It's a milestone, a turning point for a serious relationship. I have to re-emphasize the word ""serious"" because today's young people are too pragmatic! They were inspired by a freer, less restrictive way of loving from the previous generation - not to mention - your 8x generation and our first 9x. Young people now are more emotional, about the moment of mad love: even though it is called ""love"", ""seriousness"" is still present in the affirmation of something great. That's the first thing. The following second story, based on my limited experience, I have observed that girls exhibit a markedly competitive nature in love. Competing in study, at work, in trendy clothes… yes, women who have lovers also bother to compare “brothers”. The lover is put on the scale in all aspects: height - weight - 3-round measurements (even stricter than the international male king contest!), hobbies, eating habits at restaurants, neatness when paying bills, attitude towards service staff when shopping, and so on. The girl who has a lover a little better is in the heart of smoldering joy all day. I know, like a kid being rewarded with a nice coupon, it's recognition, positive interest in the guy next to him, also a compliment to his taste/choices. . she. The first and second stories, along with the detail that Miss B's lover wanted the whole family to have lunch after posing for a photo, made an elderly single person like me rethink childhood psychology. girl in true love. I also had a ""capital"" of being a talented boyfriend ""under my command"". In terms of education and body measurements, Miss A and Miss B can't be said, but it's hard for them to keep up! I'm not bragging, but it's still true, right?! See more: Decoding the heart with basic love psychology Yet life loses right at the ""debut"" screen. I don't have time to introduce the talented guy to you, but we went our separate ways. Neither of them passed the ""serious"" mark mentioned above, and the person did not have enough good qualities for me to proudly recommend to my friends. A sad story, but taught me many lessons about love. Sometimes it is better than losing each other in the background that is not sure the winner in the race to see who is the ""genuine"" boyfriend. The main thing is that when a girl falls in love, she must feel satisfied, feel proud, feel confident, feel like she wants to let the world know about the guy who makes her smile every day. That is real happiness. In short, Miss A or Miss B my friend has been in love with since college. I am a loner. But I'm also glad, because both don't want to compete anymore, each has a world to brag about. The two of you also met and discussed… wanting to go out to eat… “debut” (this is the most flattering). Just want to say a few words to the girls, in love, try to maintain your clear and tolerant worldview, to determine when to be really ""serious"", and when to be. points to be compared and corrected. Sometimes simple, easy to live!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2.0,psychology of girls when choosing a lover should listen to the left brain or the right brain?,psycholog girl choos lover listen left brain right brain,"Psychology is always an interesting topic, especially when we apply scientifically proven facts to emotional activities like love. Girls' psychology when choosing a lover is the same, have you ever wondered whether the left brain or the right brain governs the decision to choose your lover? Our brain is divided into two parts: the left hemisphere and the right hemisphere. Most tests show that the two hemispheres of the brain function both in opposition and in support of each other through the exchange of information between nerves. The right hemisphere of the brain controls the muscles on the left side of the body while the left hemisphere controls the muscles on the right side of the body. When you squint your right eye, your left brain is active. Due to the interwoven nervous system, one side of the brain controls the opposite position of your body. The most obvious example of this allocation is the activity of the drum player. When playing music, the right hand does one thing, the left hand does another; at the same time, their left foot does something different, and so does their right foot. What an interesting mechanism, showing that humans are superior to other species. We often hear people say, this child is good at math, so he uses his left brain a lot, the other is good at art, he uses his right brain a lot. Girl psychology when choosing a lover - how does the brain hemisphere work? Those are not baseless claims. Roger W. Sperry won the Nobel Prize for the theory that the brains of the two hemispheres work differently. According to this hypothesis, the left hemisphere of the brain will perform the following functions: Not only that, a neuroscience study has shown that the left brain is stimulated by new experiences, controlling the immune system and is also responsible for the body's automatic functions. such as breathing, heart rate and digestion. Therefore, people who love analysis and research are left-brained. Girl psychology when choosing a lover – The left hemisphere of the brain is inclined to logical thinking As mentioned above, our two hemispheres are similar, but perform different information processing functions. The right brain controls the left half of the body and is more artistic. Specific functions of the right hemisphere of the brain are: Girl's psychology when choosing a lover - Right hemisphere And some other sub-functions such as: Girl's psychology when choosing a lover - Right hemisphere Control emotions So the right hemisphere of the brain is responsible for human emotional activity. Not only in the psychology of girls when choosing a lover, but the overall personality of a person also shows very clearly the characteristics of the left hemisphere and the right hemisphere. Research shows that left-brained people are well-organized, often goal-oriented people. They have a high ability to focus and make decisions based on reason rather than emotions. In contrast, right-brained people are more impulsive and tend to deal with the flow of emotions. Despite such fundamental differences, each person ""in favor of"" one hemisphere of the brain has its own inclinations. If you are a logical thinker, rigorously reasoned, and inclined towards absolute accuracy, you can do jobs related to data analysis. If you have a sense of humor, love mystery stories and develop intuition, you will be well suited for creative work in the arts. The areas you are interested in/active in, especially with women, will form the ideal man more than you think. The girlfriend's psychology when choosing a lover is therefore also partly affected. With these two almost completely opposite personality groups, girls can be a little confused in managing their emotions. Theoretically, each would exhibit left-brain or right-brain dominance; however, in fact, there are people who can even throw the ball with their right hand but write with their left hand, which means they are ambidextrous. So through analyzing the personality of the left and right brain groups, we can see how the psychological expression of girls when choosing a lover? First, we notice that the left hemisphere of the brain is dominant in terms of language, it will process what you hear so that you can absorb it as quickly as possible. There is a saying ""Boys love with their eyes, girls love with their ears"". This view seems to apply precisely to this case, where analysis of auditory information helps girls choose which boys are right for them. Girls in this group tend to choose boyfriends who are quiet but intelligent and sensitive. In particular, they also pay attention to men's agile behavior and determination because the rational part strongly dominates their decisions. Because conventional teaching methods can be more talkative and focused on taking notes, left-brainers are generally rated higher than right-brained people. In particular, the girls in this group are often classified as ""souls hanging upside down from the tree"". However, girls' psychology when choosing lovers based on emotions - most decisions are made by right-brained people - help them have more sublimation in love relationships. Intuition is considered a strong human instinct, using this to judge and choose the right guy brings interesting experiences in love for women of this personality type. When in love, right-brained girls will pay attention to the guy's appearance and actions. They'll pay attention to how to handle the situation more tactfully or mentally, like trying to remind the guy of an important holiday gift. Depending on the level of expression and romance they expect from a man, the women of this group will decide which relationships can thrive and which ones will have a lot of trade-offs. In fact, although psychology determines quite a lot to the process of personality formation and decisions of people in general and women in particular, girls' psychology when choosing a lover still has ""implicit"" rules. . . This is also true because a guy who wants to impress a woman must first meet the criteria that each person sets, and this does not depend much on the right or left hemisphere of the brain!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2.0,the art of brave love,art brave love,"At the end of 4 years as a university student, I have only one love in hand. So far this is also my first love. It left me with more questions than ever, especially thinking about how hard it is for a mentally strong girl to keep the flame of the couple alive. Like many girls my age, I once envisioned finding a suitable half, meeting all the standards set by me. And then after many times being picky, I also ""choose to send gold"" to one person. He is 5 years older than me and more or less has a place in society. The path he chose to pursue is to develop an academic career alongside practicing social skills, something that I really admire. Perhaps, our love started from me forming admiration for him. I don't consider myself a strong girl, but the comments from friends and relatives help me understand more about my image in their eyes. For everyone else, I'm pretty manly and I'm a bit out of place. Due to my personality, people who meet me for the first time are usually quite reserved. I think the concept of whether a woman's psychology is strong or not is also partly formed from the above exposure impressions. With just a little bit of grit, a little bit of independence, most men will think that the girl standing in front of them is extremely resilient. My ex said that the strong and careless cover I created made him feel insecure, and somewhat… useless. Many times he felt helpless before the trifles of couples such as paying, driving or who to eat… order! I was also surprised when he shared this story. After a while of parting because of another misunderstanding, I had the opportunity to sit down with him to solve everything, but I heard these somewhat ""boring"" shares. He also said, women like me are… “no wonder drug!” So is such a strong girl mentality good or bad? How should the art of tenderness in love be skillfully expressed? On the issue of judging beautiful or ugly, I would like to answer that a strong girl is always GOOD! Today, women are actively fighting for gender equality, demonstrating their soft power in all fields not inferior to men. Therefore, strongly contributing to that flow at a macro level, and being proactive in love is also a trait that often appears in successful and happy women. However, emotional regulation is never superfluous. Agree that you can be financially independent, on an equal footing in the dating process, and really don't need him to get involved in your work decisions. But there's no denying that the subtle display that the man is in charge will sustain the relationship longer. I think what I argued above is not contradictory. We have to accept that, no matter how strong a girl's mentality is, there are still things that must be entrusted to men. They were also born with the mentality to protect women and shoulder great responsibilities such as financial problems, personal image, etc. Because of that dominant mentality, men often come to them. tender, even weak women to show their protective instinct in the most comprehensive way. They expect understanding, tolerance and bewilderment before confident, proactive girls. It is for this reason that in love there is a need for the art of tenderness.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2.0,the psychology of girls when having sex for the first time and the problem of premarital relations,psycholog girl have sex time problem premarit relat,"The psychology of a girl having sex for the first time, some people are ready, some people are nervous, even unexpected situations happen. Because it's the first time, it will forever be the most special. What about premarital sex? Many women still wonder, should sex before marriage? And more importantly, where does the relationship go after that? Let's find the answer with Modern Psychology. Having sex for the first time for a girl is a very sacred and special thing. Because of that, it creates an invisible pressure that makes it difficult for girls to achieve absolute excitement. Then there are a series of fears such as unplanned pregnancy, fear of betrayal, fear of being talked about or judged behind. At first, girls often feel stressed and anxious because the first time is often ""painful"" according to shared experiences. Psychology of a girlfriend having sex for the first time – stress and fear Because it is the first time and she is still inexperienced, as well as maybe the female friend will lack knowledge in preventing pregnancy during sex. Therefore, after having sex for the first time, women will tend to worry about whether they are pregnant or not and how to avoid pregnancy safely. Psychology of girls having sex for the first time – fear of pregnancy Girls will usually only accept relationships with people they love and trust. In fact, many men change after having their first girlfriend, which is deeply haunting for women. Make them feel afraid that after making love, will the other person change or not? Am I betrayed or not? Psychology of a girl having sex for the first time – Fear of being betrayed The psychology of a girl having a relationship for the first time is very complicated. She may agree to give you everything, but is afraid of you and everyone around you to look down on her. Although Vietnam has been more open about this issue, many people still follow the old way, always belittling and disparaging women who have sex before marriage. Psychology of girls having sex for the first time – Fear of being judged The issue of whether to have sex before marriage is always a controversial issue in society. There are always two trends for and against. Many people believe that sex is a necessary part of maintaining love. In other words, love itself is sex. We still know that physical attraction is undeniable, when starting to miss someone with only eyes, smiles, long fingers, or hair strokes, scents... sensuality - contributes arouse feelings on friendship. In particular, the psychology of girls having sex for the first time is very different from that of boys. They often look forward to a sublimation mark, not just a mere emotional activity. So sex in love from this perspective requires mental harmony, not simply physical satisfaction. If sex is only an obligation, a proof to test the feelings, it cannot bring a lasting love. Not to mention, physical harmony is also an important part of creating emotional harmony on both sides. Also, many couples divorce because of physical incompatibility. Therefore, sex before marriage is not necessarily something too difficult to accept. Today, views about sex before marriage are also somewhat biased. In fact, having sex at any time, before or after marriage is only secondary when compared to the safety of sex and psychological health, especially the psychology of girls after having sex for the first time. sex. . Premarital sex – premarital sex has many benefits However, the pressure of the “first time” will make it difficult for them to achieve absolute excitement, and then have to face the fear of having sex before marriage. pregnancy or bad things in society. A statistic in the US alone shows that many couples who have sex before marriage often use love as an excuse for this behavior. But the reality is that 80% of these loves won't last more than 6 months, so there's really no such thing as ""love"" here, it's just an instinctive justification for carnal passion. In particular, 7% of girls will experience depression after having sex for the first time. A survey by the American Foundation for Prevention of Teenage Pregnancy (12-19 years old) found that 77% of female students and 60% of male students who had ever had sex expressed regret and wished they had never had sex. ever had sex. relationship. 88% want the media to warn more about the consequences of early sex such as pregnancy, infectious diseases. 85% agree that sex should only happen in a relationship with a long-term commitment to marriage. The above figures show the fact that the psychological health of women in sexual relations, especially the first sex before marriage, is very worrying. Psychologically, many women said that even though they were married, they still could not forget their first partner and often tacitly compared them with their husbands, leading to an increased risk of infidelity. Many others worry that if their children learn about their past, they will no longer respect and listen to them. In addition, there is a fact that very few girls notice, that once they voluntarily give themselves to their lover, it also means that they have to accept that it may be considered easy, or not. it has to be. The first time leads to broken love. Besides, there are also cases where players leave their girlfriends after being virgins. Sex before marriage - many downsides show that sex before marriage is not recommended Others think that sex after marriage has a sacred meaning and is a testament to each person's dignity . women. However, this view is strongly opposed by the modern young generation. They believe that sex is the original human instinct, it should not be reduced to a moral standard to evaluate human personality, especially a woman's personality.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2.0,10 psychological criteria guys when choosing a girlfriend is a girl right?,psycholog criterion guy choos girlfriend girl right,"Men are like women, they always set standards for their partners. So do girls know what boys' psychology is when choosing a girlfriend? If you knew the following male standards, would you feel the same way? Let's also Modern Psychology answers. At a certain age, a boy's mentality when choosing a girlfriend ""matches his age"" will form. Because when two people have the same situation, lifestyle, way of thinking and talking, understanding will be easier and there will be less big conflicts in family life later. However, you should remember that it is suitable for ""now"" and not for ""future"". Men's psychology when choosing a girlfriend - Suitable for the current self. There are few female friends with the same opinion here. From a girl's point of view, they want to choose a person who is suitable for them not only now but also in the future, who can be with them for the rest of their lives. Therefore, every time she fails in love, a girl often breaks down and can't quickly get out of love like a boy. There is nothing more attractive than a girl who is always confident in her body and speaking style. If you always ask him questions like, “Does this dress make your thighs bigger? or “Does this hairstyle age you?” You must stop now! Instead, choose clothes that make you more beautiful so that you can confidently stand in front of him. A boy's mentality when choosing a girlfriend is to always want his lover to be confident when walking alongside him. It is the girlfriend who will be a great motivation for the boyfriend to grow up and be more confident in front of others. Men's psychology when choosing a girlfriend – Confidence For women, too, a confident man always has a great attraction to women. Because they feel the strength of this man, and at the same time the man's confidence is the sense of security that women want. What a man wants in a woman is someone who can stand on her own. So when choosing a girlfriend, guys always want a girl who is smart and understanding. Those are all things to light up a beautiful love of two people. Guy's mentality when choosing a girlfriend – Confidence For girls, this standard seems a bit low. They just want a faithful, understanding, industrious, industrious, industrious partner who can shoulder the work. That person is not quite intelligent, but absolutely not intelligent. Thus, it can be seen that there is a slight difference in this view between the two sexes. Because everyone's goals are different. Boys are always adventurous and aggressive while girls want to be safe first. He wants to be your armor-clad knight. And of course, he wants you to be his princess too. But that doesn't give you the right to act like: demand fancy, expensive dinners or lavish, expensive jewelry. He'll be more than relieved not to have to spend his entire salary on those luxuries. Men's psychology when choosing a girlfriend – Confident girls too, they also do not put material problems on their men. When choosing a lover, they pay more attention to the person and personality of the other person. Perhaps both men and women understand that it is personality and bravery that creates people, creates matter, not material makes people. One of the best things you can do for your partner is relax. Men's psychology when choosing a girlfriend sometimes just needs one person to help him feel comfortable! Men's psychology when choosing a girlfriend - the comfort the other person brings Not only boys, in love relationships, everyone wants to find a companion who can make them comfortable. After many difficulties and hardships outside, they just want to be with someone who makes them feel comfortable, understand and love them. Men's psychology when choosing a girlfriend is to like girls who laugh at them. They prefer witty women to nagging all the time. Instead of criticizing the food he cooks for you badly, give suggestions in a witty tone, surely the atmosphere of the meal will become more cheerful. Men's psychology when choosing a girlfriend – humor Women too, a smart person is not necessarily funny but a funny person will definitely be smart. Because they know how to create joy in life, know how to make people happy and remove all sadness. If he doesn't trust you, how can you be his other half? Stay open and honest in your relationship. A lie that gets out of control will cause the relationship to fall apart. That's the mentality of guys when choosing a girlfriend.

Let him have his own space, otherwise he will easily come to the decision to break up with you. Independent women are those who can stimulate the pursuit of men, especially successful men. Because an independent woman knows when to be mature and when to be naive. They know how to manage their lover but do not interfere too much in the other's private life. Men's psychology when choosing a girlfriend – independence Women are no exception, when choosing a boyfriend, they also want to choose an independent person because it proves that the other person is a reliable person with a future. and understand reason.

School-age love is so beautiful, it's also the days when we go to school together in our senior year, have lunch together or sometimes just buy each other a small souvenir. The other party feels happy all day, especially, the mentality of the 17-year-old boy when he loves is very fond of pampering and making his girlfriend happy, showing affection and always ""cheesy"" with his girlfriend. In addition, there are feelings of anger the first time when we see our girlfriend with someone other than in the back of our car, when unanswered messages also make us more frustrated. 17-year-old love is something very interesting, also very sacred and beautiful for those who have experienced it.

There are many couples today who are former classmates, they fell in love at the age of 17 and married at the age of 24. The first days were pure love of school age, they fell in love, stayed together during college and finally decided to spend the rest of their days together so they wouldn't have to be apart. have to break up. There is nothing better than an eternal and only love! I once witnessed a couple who have known each other since middle school, it has been nearly 10 years now, they still hold hands every day, walking together on the path of happiness. Even in that process, there are quarrels, difficulties, and confusion, but they are always together, comfort each other, support each other, grow up and be happy together. As for other couples, who fell in love at the age of 17 but couldn't go to the end together, don't be sad or resentful. Above all, we still have to thank that 17-year-old friend for crying, laughing, and having fun with us during the first years of his life. You must have seen many couples who knew each other since the age of 17, then broke up after a short time. It is not too difficult to accept because you are young, naive, not patient enough, not mature enough to adjust your emotions, adjust your behavior, to forgive. There will be times when you hear insiders say that maybe they can't love anyone anymore, the person they love the most doesn't want to be with them anymore. But my friend, that's the mentality of a 17-year-old guy when it comes to love. They think they are mature enough to understand what love is, but it's not. Maybe after a while you will see the guy dancing out there and have a new love. That's it, easy to come and easy to go. However, no matter how things change, 17-year-old love still occupies a small corner of the hearts of these teenage boys. Under the mentality of a 17-year-old boy when in love, love is not too intense but still enough to make our hearts flutter and miss the beautiful days. Someone once said: ""Youth is like a shower, even if you catch a cold, you still want to come back to be wet again"". That's right because those are the first emotions in life, a carefree time when you don't have to worry too much about life. It will be a great regret for someone at the age of 17 without a love, without the beautiful moments of school age. 17 years old, let's love but stop at pure love, boys.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Or does the colleague sitting next to you choose sports shoes over high heels at work?

2.0,"talking about the ""beast"" of one-sided love",talk beast onesid love,"From 9th grade to 12th grade, I had a crush on a boy. This guy studies well, plays sports well. In the eyes of teenage girls, the nerd combo still works enough to overshadow the mediocre beauty of boys who are also going through puberty in general. For those four years, I was alone with this guy. The psychology of a girl when she loves one-sidedly is very tender. Being at school age again, everything is more sensitive. If he actively texts first or says good night, his heart is already racing. For a moment, it felt like nothing more was needed. Just a little care is enough. Many times, I mustered up the courage to meet before evening class just to have a quick dumpling or a cup of tea, but I had to prepare myself a week in advance. It feels like a century has passed in the blink of an eye. If he accepts the offer, then he starts thinking about the second stage, which is the outfit and how to appear in front of him, and then the topic of conversation to probe the other party's intentions. Thinking back, when I was a student, having such a one-sided love was so much fun. Too bad this guy sucks on me. Who in the psychological life of a girl, when in one-sided love, accepts to condescend to pursue a guy, he even lets her climb a few more dates, innocently using the excuse ... ""I forgot"" without thinking about it. mood. extreme disappointment of a girl at that time. Totally bad! Forgot to say that I suffer. If you go to the horoscope a few times without being kicked back, you will be lucky, and you will also receive free advice on the word of mouth that the love road is not good. Everyone said it was like being cast out of a mold, that even if it wasn't that bad, sticking to any of them would lead to one problem after another. Now that I think about it, one-sided love is the only way to avoid trouble. Why so? Because one-sided love helps girls avoid the usual troubles in a ""bilateral"" love. I'm not very familiar with girl psychology when it comes to unrequited love in general, but personally, I find being patient and brave in pursuing someone helps a girl grow up and become more confident. . When people fall in love and officially enter into a relationship, these challenges will always be put before them, because of the psychological development of both people. One-sided love rarely encounters this, because the person who is liked often does not like the person who pursues him. They have a price to pay, moreover, if they liked the person pursuing them, they wouldn't have let them be so unilateral! Psychologists have posed a situation to better analyze the role of the pursuer and the pursued in this case. From there, they draw the observation that there will often be a difference in the level of affection in unrequited love - like other love relationships. The greater the difference, the harsher one-sided love. The smaller the difference, the less painful one-sided love, on the contrary, it still brings emotions to the more disadvantaged - the pursuer. I once read an article about girls' psychology when in one-sided love, meaning that as long as the person you love is happy, then you are also happy. I don't think this is cliché, because love is the most complex emotion in the world, a rare one that our minds cannot fully control. Perhaps for this reason, love is celebrated and appreciated. ""I also don't advise you, especially girls, not to fall in love. I think one-sided love is a very pure, original love and most clearly shows human nature. The boundary of love. the pursuit of politeness, culture says a lot about the nature of a good girl, as well as whether this is true love when out of respect for people, Back to the story of me and the guy I'm lonely above, after 2 times mustering up the courage to confess, he still rejected me a lot. firmly. Now looking back, how do I see myself? so lucky!"" The guy that I like and work hard to pursue is really an ideal model. I also liked me that year when I liked him (I “borrowed” Kha Canh Dang from “You Are The Apple Of My Eye”). There are many reasons why girls in one-sided love are often too shy or too aggressive, and fortunately in both cases I am not like that. Therefore, the memories I have when I like that guy are very pure and lovely. After a few years as a student, I am still quite proud of this one-sided story. I call unrequited love ""caring"". It should not be nurtured as another normal habit or hobby, but should forge noble virtues from a certain unrequited love, practice observation, practice patience to understand a person, to decide whether one can really worthy of his love or not.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, introverts have good awareness of their own thoughts and feelings, so they are also thoughtful and quiet people. After reading your post, Milcah realizes that you have all of the above personality traits, and so you can say you are a typical Introvert. In psychology, there is a process of self-perception called Availability Bias, which causes us to make decisions based on the first information that comes to mind rather than objective criteria. . This bias has a relatively large influence on the assessment of Introvert and Extrovert personality: You see, whether it's Introvert or Extrovert, each personality trend has its own pros and cons, none of which which is like which. Which character is superior? If you're an Introvert, you can't be an Extrovert because that's simply a tendency of your personality. When you are an Introvert you shine in your own unique way and that way you can take pride in your personality traits and learn to be true to yourself instead of trying to be yourself. become another person.

3.0,how do i know if health information is good or bad?,know health inform good bad,"Anyone can submit anything online. Readers must think critically about information to decide whether it is useful, truthful, or safe. Here are the key points to keep in mind as you determine which information is worth considering and which does not pass the test. It is easy to spread information online and we cannot assume that the source we are reading or viewing is the original source. Before you can judge anything, you need to know where those claims are coming from and determine if it's a reliable source. Trusted sources about coronavirus and COVID-19 include the World Health Organization (WHO), Government of Canada ministries and agencies such as Health Canada and Public Health Canada, BC Government ministries and agencies such as the BC Department of Health, and the BC Centers for Disease Control (BCCDC). Scientists and researchers at universities and other institutions and health science professionals are also important sources of information. Titles and titles need to be simple and short, so they can sometimes be misleading. They can also be purposefully shocking or controversial to entice you to click to read more. Websites belonging to the government, government-funded agency, well-known medical provider, university, or group of medical professionals are generally the most trusted. Beware of sites that don't list authors or don't tell you much about them. Double-check the author and credentials of any cited or cited 'experts' to see if they are truly experts in the subject under discussion. Can you find other evidence from other sources to support the claims? Do authors list their sources? Are the sources legitimate, such as research journals? Unhelpful sources want you to feel a certain way: scared, angry, distrustful, vulnerable. Phrases like ""Infection rates soar"" are sensational, and they're meant to scare people off. On the other hand, factual statements like ""We have 50 new cases in BC"" give you important information without affecting your emotions. News or helpful resources want you to feel informed and empowered. Who is paying for the site? What product or service is being advertised? What links or other sites do they promote? Are you learning something from a story or experience, or are you simply being directed to buy a product or service? Social media can be a great way to stay in touch with family and friends, especially as we practice social distancing or self-quarantine. Social media can also be an important way to learn from medical professionals and connect with support services and mutual support groups in your community. Like any other source of information, it's important to use good critical thinking skills when you use social media. Studies show that searching for health information on social media often has very different results. You will find both very poor quality sources in addition to good quality sources and it is up to you to decide which one. Also, social media posts tend to be short and rarely capture everything you need to consider. They are often more useful as a way to start learning or explore different points of view than as a place to gather all the information.

Sometimes your interpretation of a situation can be distorted and you focus only on the negative aspects—this is normal and to be expected. However, when you interpret situations too negatively, you may feel worse. You're also more likely to react to situations in ways that aren't helpful in the long run. These automatic thoughts and assumptions are sometimes called thought traps. People sometimes fall into unbalanced thinking traps. You're more likely to distort your interpretation of things when you're already feeling sad, angry, worried, depressed, or stressed. You are also more likely to fall into the trap of thinking when you don't take good care of yourself, such as when you don't eat well or sleep well. Here are some common thought traps: Thinking that a negative situation is part of a constant cycle of bad things happening. People who overgeneralize often use words like ""always"" or ""never"". I was really looking forward to that concert, and now it has been cancelled. This always happens to me! I could never do interesting things! See everything as just right or wrong, good or bad, perfect or bad. Black and white thinkers see a small mistake as a complete failure. I want to eat healthier, but today I ate too much junk food. This plan is a complete failure! Only say negative things about yourself or others. I made a mistake. I am stupid! My boss told me I made a mistake. My boss is a total jerk! Predicting that something bad will happen without any proof. I did what I could to stay home and reduce the risk, but I just knew I was going to get sick.

Believing that bad feelings or emotions reflect the situation. I feel scared and overwhelmed right now, so that means everything is very bad and will never get better. Tell yourself how you ""should"" or ""must"" act. I should be able to handle this without getting upset and crying! Here are helpful strategies for challenging common thinking traps. Many people find their mood and confidence improved after practicing these skills. You can also find worksheets to help you with each step at www.heretohelp.bc.ca. Don't try to break out of the thought trap by telling yourself to stop thinking that way. This does not allow you to look at the evidence and challenge the thinking trap. As you try to push the unpleasant thoughts away, they are more likely to keep coming back to your mind. Ask yourself the following questions after something unpleasant happens: What is the situation? What really happened? Only include facts that everyone will agree on. What is your opinion? What are you saying to yourself? What are your feelings? How do you feel? What is your behavior? How are you reacting? What are you doing to cope? Take a look at the thoughts you've listed. Are you using any thought traps and falling into the wrong way of thinking? It is normal to fall into more than one thought trap. Go back to the mind trap list and determine which one is right for you and your current situation. The best way to break the thought trap is to look at your thinking like a scientist and examine the hard facts. Use the evidence you've gathered to challenge your thinking traps. Here are some ways to do it: Try to find evidence against that thought. If you make a mistake at work, you can automatically think, ""I can't do anything! I must be a lousy employee!"" When this thought comes up, you can challenge it by asking, ""Is there any evidence to support this idea? Is there any evidence to disprove this idea?"" You may quickly find that your boss has been praising your work recently, which doesn't support the idea that you're a bad employee. Ask yourself: ""Would I judge others if they did the same? Am I more strict with myself than others?"" This is a great way to challenge the thought traps associated with harsh self-criticism. Find out if other people you trust agree with your thinking. For example, you might have a problem with one of your children and think, ""Good parents wouldn't have this kind of problem."" To challenge this thinking, you can ask other parents if they have ever had problems with their children. Test your faith in people. For example, if you think your friends aren't interested in you, call a few friends and plan to start a regular video call. If you assume they'll all decline, you might be surprised to learn that they want to see you. Once you've overcome some of the challenges, try to come up with a more balanced mindset to replace the old thought traps. Let's use the following example: I feel sad and overwhelmed. I'm having a hard time figuring out what to do. I am the worst! I will be able to handle this! Label the statement 'Should' Check the proof: I have a lot of challenges right now. I worry about my family and everything seems to change so quickly. I have successfully handled complex situations in the past so I know I can do it. You're probably feeling uncomfortable right now - there's a lot going on. I will think about how I overcame situations in the past and see what worked for me. I'm trying to do a lot of things on my own, so I'll talk to my family so we can plan and work together.

1.0,how can i manage grief?,manag grief,"While many people think of grief as the loss of a person or pet, grief can occur whenever you lose something important. This includes: Insecurity, such as losing your job, or wondering how long you can afford to pay rent Instability or habits, such as finding yourself working from home or finding direction closing the daycare Loss of a sense of security, such as fear that you or someone you love may end up with COVID-19 Loss of your social relationships, such as losing time with family and friends friends as people now practice social distancing or self-isolation Losing hope for the future, such as feeling that life will never return to normal Losing important goals, such as such as finding your classes, sports competitions or concerts canceled in the near future Losing important milestone celebrations like graduations and weddings Grief brings complicated emotions . You may feel sad, angry, frustrated, scared, or hopeless. You may have trouble eating or sleeping, or feel very stressed. You may feel overwhelmed and tired. You may be wondering if life will ever return to normal. Everyone grieve in their own way and in their own time. Here are some strategies to try as you navigate your own journey. Acknowledge and express your feelings in a healthy way. Name your feelings and find healthy ways to express them, such as talking to friends, journaling, or creating art. Give yourself as much time as you need. Grief follows its own schedule. Allow yourself to use this time to take care of your health. Letting go of other expectations, duties or obligations can wait. Seek support. Grief can make you feel very isolated, even though so many people are going through some loss right now. Reach out to friends or family and share your feelings. Find ways to help and support each other. Take care of yourself. Ignoring health and happiness can make difficult experiences worse. Eat as well as you can, try to get enough sleep, spend time outside if it's safe for you, and exercise regularly. Think about self-care activities or strategies that have helped you cope with difficult situations in the past, and make time for those activities. Know that grief will pass. Grief can feel intense at times, but those emotions will become more manageable over time and will eventually pass. Connect with a mental health professional if you are struggling. If you're having trouble during your day, coping in unhealthy ways, or having trouble managing difficult thoughts or feelings, you should seek help from a professional such as a psychologist or counselors—many now offer online services or phone appointments.

1.0,what is the difference between a psychiatrist and a registered psychologist?,differ psychiatrist regist psychologist,"psychiatrist is a medical doctor with additional training in mental health who may choose to prescribe medication. Some use psychotherapy ('talk therapy') as cognitive behavioral therapy to treat mental health problems. Many psychiatrists work in hospitals, clinics, or health centers, and some have their own offices. Since they are specialists, you will almost always need a referral from another doctor to see a psychiatrist, and the MSP will cover the fees. If you have a valid BC Service Card or CareCard, you do not need to pay to see a psychiatrist. A registered psychologist focuses on different counseling or talk therapy approaches to treatments, but they do not prescribe medication. They have graduate degrees in psychology. There are two different ways to approach registered psychologists: the public system and the private system. Psychologists registered in the public system work in certain hospitals or schools. You may need a doctor's referral to access the plan, and costs are usually covered by the MSP. However, most people need to access registered psychologists through the private system. To do this, you can contact the psychologist yourself—you don't need a referral. Expenses are not covered by MSP, but they may be covered by employee health plans. Registered psychologists' fees vary by the hour, and some offer lower rates for lower income earners. You may find that a lot of the differences stem from how you pay for different services and how these professionals are trained. The actual difference in how they work is not always obvious. When it comes to your treatment and care, the most important part is finding a professional who supports your own goals. Are you really focused on medication adjustment? Are you looking for a specific treatment? Is the philosophy of expert care right for you? Do you like the expert you're talking to and do you feel safe sharing your experience? Ultimately, your relationship with the new professional is what matters. Instead of focusing on the designation, find a professional who meets your needs and expectations.

5.0,what is the difference between psychotherapy and counseling?,differ psychotherapi counsel,"Psychotherapy and counseling have much in common and often mean the same thing. Both are used to describe professionals who use a talk-based approach to help someone recover from a mental illness or mental health problem. Many different professionals can provide counseling or psychotherapy, including registered psychologists, registered clinical counselors, psychiatrists, therapists and other counselors, family doctors, psychiatric nurses and faith leaders. It can be helpful to talk to someone about any problem—many people find that simply talking to friends or family can help them feel better. A professional therapist or counselor can offer much more: they are trained, experienced, and emotionally distant (because they don't know you). They use different theories to listen to you, support you, and approach different problems or models. For example, psychotherapy called cognitive-behavioral therapy is based on the theory that learning skills to change your thoughts and actions can have a positive impact on your emotions, health and well-being. your future thoughts and behavior. A therapist can help you learn and practice these skills. There are many psychotherapies that have strong evidence of effectiveness for various problems or illnesses. Some examples include cognitive-behavioral therapy, interpersonal communication therapy, dialectical behavior therapy, solution-focused brief psychotherapy, narrative therapy, and focus therapy. focus on emotions. In general, some aspects of therapy and counseling are the same, no matter which approach you choose: the expectations you bring to the counseling sessions, the fit between your understanding of the problem and your understanding. your therapist's knowledge of the problem, and the trust and relationship you have with your therapist. In fact, one research review found that 50% of an improvement was seen in clients who both received active listening and support from a counselor (known as undirected supportive therapy) alone. It simply depends on the relationship between the client and the therapist.1 Psychotherapy may and may not work, but the profession you choose, and their fit with your values, is just as important. . When you're looking for a professional, it's always a good idea to ask if they're a member of a professional organization (such as those listed in the next section).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5.0,what is the difference between cbt and dbt?,differ cbt dbt,"CBT (cognitive-behavioral therapy) and DBT (dialectical behavior therapy) are two forms of psychotherapy or “talk therapy”. In both, you work with a mental health professional to learn more about the challenges you face and learn skills to help you manage your own challenges. Cognitive-behavioral therapy or CBT teaches you how your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors influence each other. For example, if you believe that people don't like you (thinking), you might avoid social situations (behavior) and feel lonely (feeling). However, CBT teaches you how to use these relationships to your advantage: a positive change in one factor (thinking or behavior change) can lead to positive changes in all. all factors.

You will learn how to use your new skills to solve future problems. Dialectical behavior therapy or DBT is based on CBT, which focuses more on emotional and social aspects. DBT was developed to help people deal with extreme or unstable emotions and harmful behaviors. DBT is an evidence-based method to help people regulate their emotions. It started out as a treatment for borderline personality disorder, and current research shows it can help a variety of mental illnesses or anxiety, especially self-harm. The main difference between CBT and DBT is authentication and relationships. DBT teaches you that your experiences are real, and it teaches you to accept who you are, no matter how challenging or difficult the experience is. Relationships are also important in DBT—including the relationships between you and your DBT students. You can often sign up to talk about any successes or problems. Treatment may include a combination of face-to-face sessions and group therapy. In addition to CBT skills, you will learn skills around managing your emotions, building relationships with others, coping well with problems or suffering, acceptance and mindfulness. As with many talk therapies, it takes time and effort to enjoy the benefits of CBT and DBT skills. But once people master skills with support from your CBT or DBT therapist, they often find that their new skills and strategies become second nature—they are survival tools. at lifetime.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This can be a difficult situation—you want to help, but most adults are responsible for taking care of themselves. There are two important points to think about. First, diagnosing a health condition, especially when it's so easy to check for symptoms online, can be dangerous. The best diagnosis is always left to the experts who can look at the big picture. Also keep in mind that the person you care about may have a very different view of what is causing their problems and the negative impact on their life. Second, except in rare cases, the person receiving treatment needs to be actively involved in their own recovery in order to continue treatment, just like for any other health problem.

The way we can or should help seems pretty obvious when a loved one has a physical health problem, but many people say they're not sure how best to help when a loved one has a mental illness like depression. . Here are some tips: You don't have to understand exactly what the other person is going through, you just need to realize that it's a difficult experience. You could try something like, ""I can see that this experience or these symptoms is really causing you pain,"" or ""I'm sorry to hear that you're not feeling well."" depression, you might say, ""I know how you feel."" Just remember that everyone experiences illnesses like depression differently, and empathy is about recognizing the impact of the illness, not comparing the symptoms. You don't have to be an expert, but learning more about depression can help you understand what's going on (and possibly dispel some of the unhelpful myths surrounding depression). Our Depression fact sheet is a great place to start, and we have a list of resources at Q&A: Where can I learn more about depression? Sometimes it can be helpful to talk about real issues or concerns—in fact, many people with mood disorders say they just want to be heard. It's important to understand that talking about something as difficult as a depressive experience can be very difficult for your loved one. You can't get them to talk about it, but you can invite them in and create a safe and quiet space to talk. If a loved one opens up to you, listen actively—that is, without the distractions of the phone or TV. Really pay attention to what they say. Listen with empathy and without judgment. Even if you don't understand the problem or see it in a different way, your main concern is the pain or difficult feeling your loved one is going through. In-depth tips for listening and communicating well can be found in Module Three of the Family Toolkit. Some people are not willing to talk about everything at once or say it all. It's OK! Respect your loved one's boundaries and let them tell you what they're willing to talk about. Even with the best of intentions, unsolicited advice may not be helpful. You may not be able to fix the problem and you may not know the full story. If you'd like to share what worked for you in a similar situation, you can ask if the other person would like to talk about strategies that worked for you. Different people need different things—don't assume you know what's best! Some people need emotional help, such as someone they can talk to. Others may have a good relationship with a counselor or other professional, but they may need practical help, like helping around the house or helping to stick to their treatment plan. And others may just want to be involved in some social events. By asking what a person needs, you can also give less advice. When people go through a depressive episode, they can have a lot of very negative thoughts and feelings. This can cause real damage to others. You should seek support for yourself—there are support groups just for family members and friends. The BC Schizophrenia Association has a list of family support groups across BC for any mental illness.

If a loved one opens up to you, listen actively—that is, without the distractions of the phone or TV. Really pay attention to what they say. Give them time to complete their thought, even if it takes longer than usual. Listen with empathy and without judgment. Even if you don't understand the problem or you see it in a different way, your main concern is the pain or difficult feeling your loved one is going through. In-depth tips for listening and communicating well can be found in Module Three of the Family Toolkit. Some people are not willing to talk about everything at once or say it all. It's OK! Respect your loved one's boundaries and let them tell you when they're ready to talk. Symptoms of schizophrenia such as hallucinations (feelings that aren't real, like hearing voices) or delusions (beliefs that can't be true, like believing you're being watched by a spy) may go away. a time to stop even if people are being treated and follow their treatment plan. As a group, these very distressing symptoms are called psychosis. Many people have difficulty reacting to a loved one's hallucinations or delusions. It is best to avoid arguing about these experiences. Remember that delusions are symptoms of schizophrenia—they are not thoughts you can tell someone. Telling someone that their experience wasn't real or real isn't going to help when the experience makes that person feel so real! A better approach is to empathize with the sensations that hallucinations or delusions cause—without confirming or denying the hallucination or delusion. For example, if a loved one feels frustrated or upset when they hear a voice, it won't help if you say something like, “You're okay! It's not real. I can not hear anything."" Instead, you could say, “I can only imagine how annoying that voice must have been. I can see the voice that makes you feel scared.” Know that with good treatment and support, symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions will become much easier for people to control and lessen in importance. Ask how you can help. When people have a serious mental illness such as schizophrenia, they may want to make a plan for how they can act if they start to feel unwell again, especially if they have dependent children. These plans, such as advanced directives or the Ulysses Agreement, are made when a person is feeling well and are intended to communicate their wishes to loved ones and their care team. Ask your loved one if they have a plan so you know what they need if they need help. If you want to learn more about care planning, check out the BC Schizophrenia Association. If a loved one is going through a psychotic episode or recovering from a psychotic episode, they may need extra help. For example, people who are actively experiencing hallucinations or delusions may need a lot of personal space and feel uncomfortable around many people or even making eye contact. When people are recovering from a psychotic episode, they may need a quiet space and plenty of rest. Sometimes people can get back to their usual routines fairly quickly, while other times it can take a lot of time (and effort) to get back into the routines. Remember that too much help can be somewhat counterproductive. It may be quicker and easier to take on your loved one's tasks or chores on your own, but rebuilding activity and confidence is an important part of the recovery process. Encourage and support your loved one as they take on daily responsibilities and let them tell you when they need extra help. Schizophrenia can be a difficult illness to treat—for everyone. During episodes of psychosis, your loved one may experience frightening feelings that you cannot understand. They may act in ways that you don't understand. Other symptoms of schizophrenia can make it difficult for people to express feelings or emotions, communicate clearly, or seem interested in others. It is important to know that these are symptoms of an illness. They're no one's fault, but they can still be difficult to deal with. Consider reaching out to family and friends support groups for assistance. The BC Schizophrenia Association has a list of groups around BC at www.bcss.org/monthly-meetings-calendar/. As a family member, it is important for you to take care of yourself. Try to maintain your regular schedule and activities, such as your exercise routine and hobbies. Ask another family member or good friend to help with care, especially in the early days of your loved one's illness. If you need help balancing self-care with caregiving duties, check out the BC Schizophrenia Association Family Respite Program. Try to maintain the friendships or networks of people you have in your life. These will later become important supports as your loved one recovers. Educate them and keep them updated on your loved one's recovery. People are sometimes afraid to ask questions about schizophrenia and this will put them at ease. This is very important! You are not responsible for the treatment of your loved one (unless your loved one is your child under 19), but you can support them. Schizophrenia can make it difficult for people to make and get to appointments and to stick to their treatment plan. With your loved one's permission, you can choose to help by reminding them of appointments, driving them to appointments, or whatever helps in your situation. If your loved one is unhappy with their treatment or wants to try a new one, you can encourage them to talk to their care team, such as a doctor or mental health team— stopping or changing treatment can be very dangerous. treatment without medical assistance. Treatment can be a difficult area for loved ones. It's hard to see someone you love in pain. You may be afraid of what your loved one is going through. You want to help. But for any treatment to work, your loved one needs to actively care for them. Coercion or threat of treatment is often ineffective (or if it is, in an emergency, only in the short term) and can often hurt those involved. In most cases, anyone 19 years of age or older and not at risk of harm is free to choose. And their options may include refusing treatment or choosing treatment with which you disagree.

1.0,"cannabis is legal for over 19s but there are groups of doctors who say it has the potential to be harmful for 25s. any uses or certain uses? what is the myth and what is the truth? if i am a parent, what should i tell my youth?",cannabi legal s group doctor potenti harm s use certain use myth truth parent tell youth,"Cannabis use has the potential to bring benefits and harms. Young people use cannabis, like other psychoactive drugs, to feel good, to feel better, to do better, or to explore. Trying marijuana out of curiosity, as an experiment, or while socializing with friends, is associated with moderate use and a lower likelihood of harm. Using marijuana to cope with everyday life, deal with unpleasant feelings, or fit in with a social group is more likely to cause harm. This is because solving these types of problems involves more and more frequent use, less thought about potential harms, and less consideration of alternatives to cope, such as talk to a parent or trusted adult or get physically active with a friend. Evidence shows that the younger a person is when they start using marijuana, and the more often they use it, the greater the potential for harm. The legal age to use marijuana in BC is 19. However, our brains don't fully develop until about 25 years old. Delaying marijuana use until early adulthood may reduce potentially harmful effects on the brain. Some young people, especially those with multiple factors that predispose them to severe and persistent mental health problems, may not be able to use marijuana. Marijuana is associated with an increased risk of psychosis and schizophrenia in this small group of people. Some people with serious mental health problems also report that using marijuana has helped them cope with illness by helping them feel less anxious or stressed. As in most situations, balancing the benefits and potential harms of marijuana use will be key for young people with serious mental health concerns. Mixing drugs, such as marijuana and alcohol, can also increase the likelihood of harm. Intoxication can be more intense and prolonged and young people may not be able to appreciate how impaired they are. We often recommend ""Not too much, not too often, and only in the context of safety"" as a simple way to assess your use of any psychoactive substance. As a parent or caring adult, an open, respectful relationship with a young person is one of your best resources and ways to prevent the harms of substance use. Let your teen know that they can approach you at any time to talk about marijuana, other substances, or anything else that interests them, shows that they matter to you and that you are willing to listen and engage in dialogue with them. This is a great place to start tackling anything that can happen in a young person's life!

1.0,what is the difference between mental health and mental illness?,differ mental health mental ill,"'Mental health' and 'mental illness' are increasingly used as if they mean the same thing, but that is not the case. Everyone has mental health, just like everyone has health. As the World Health Organization famously says, “There is no health without mental health.” Over the course of a lifetime, not everyone will develop a mental illness, but everyone will struggle or have challenges with their mental health (i.e. their mental health) just like everyone else. We sometimes face challenges with our physical health. When we talk about mental health, we are talking about our mental health: our feelings, thoughts and emotions, our ability to solve problems and overcome difficulties, our social relationships and understanding. us about the world around us. Mental illness is an illness that affects the way people think, feel, behave, or interact with others. There are many different mental illnesses, and they have different symptoms that affect people's lives in different ways. Health is not like an on/off switch. There are different levels of health. People move continuously from excellent or good health to normal health to poor health to disease or disability. For example, some people are in good health and have no problems in their lives. Some people have serious health problems, and their poor health has a very negative impact on their lives. Some people have serious health problems that last a long time, and others have serious health problems that resolve very quickly. Many people fall somewhere in between — they are generally in good health, although problems can occur from time to time. Mental health is the same. Just as a person who feels unwell may not have a serious illness, people can have poor mental health without a mental illness. We all have days when we feel a bit frustrated, stressed, or overwhelmed by something going on in our lives. An important part of good mental health is the ability to see problems or concerns realistically. Good mental health isn't always about feeling 100% happy and confident and ignoring every problem. It's about living and dealing well with problems. Just as it is possible to have poor mental health but not have a mental illness, it is entirely possible to have good mental health even with a diagnosis of mental illness. That's because mental illnesses (like other health problems) often come in waves, meaning there are times ('episodes') of poor health and times of better or better health. than. With the right tools and support, anyone can live well—however they clearly identify—and find meaning, contribute to the community, and work toward their goals.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While substance use can clearly contribute to health and social problems, substances can be beneficial for some people under certain circumstances. For example, many people celebrate a special occasion with a glass of fine wine. Some people use tobacco as a powerful symbol in cultural and spiritual rituals. In fact, substances have been used by humans throughout history for a variety of reasons: to feel better, to improve performance, for cultural/mental reasons, and to have better experiences. new experience. Substance use is much more complicated than just “good” or “bad.” It is helpful to think about substance use on a continuum, from beneficial use to harmful use. In the middle of a continuum, substance use can be both beneficial and harmful. You have an enjoyable evening with friends, but feel a bit sick the next day. At the end of the continuum, some people develop dependence—they need constant medication to feel normal and will continue to use it even if it leads to financial hardship, problems at home or at work, health or legal problems. problems. In general, substance use is a problem when it causes problems for you or others—and the extent to which use causes problems will be different for different people in different situations.

Those of us who drink, finding the benefits of alcohol, it's not difficult. But sometimes we start using more and more often than is reasonable. As a general rule, drinking becomes a problem when it negatively affects our own lives or the lives of others. Many people imagine this referring to people who drink alcohol “all day every day”. But even drinking too much in one sitting can lead to a problem, such as making a bad decision such as driving when depressed. It is also important to recognize the potential for negative consequences associated with drinking in different contexts (e.g. place, time, and activity) and over time (e.g.: dealing with chronic problems). You can get personalized feedback regarding your drinking habits against Canada's Low Risk Drinking Guidelines through the Alcohol Fact Check screening app. This short, simple display can be used by people of all ages.

And, while all drugs have an effect on the brain, the specific properties of the drug affect the risk of harmful consequences. For example, the negative effects of marijuana on the brain appear to be less than the effects of certain substances such as alcohol. Legalizing cannabis provides an opportunity to introduce regulations to reduce potential harm. The danger of buying and using any illegal drug is that we can never know for sure exactly what is in it. Cannabis is legal in Canada as of October 17, 2018. Adults (over 19 years old in BC) are currently allowed to possess up to 30 grams of marijuana in public. Cannabis is regulated by the Province of British Columbia and will be sold through the Alcohol Distribution Branch. Cannabis will be tested for quality. When drugs are produced and obtained in a regulated system, we can know about the strength and dosage of what we are taking. This helps us manage risk. However, it is likely that cannabis will still be available outside of the government system. It is important to know that the quality of cannabis obtained from a dealer or a friend is unknown and may contain contaminants such as mold, mildew, or potentially toxic fillers. The legalization of marijuana also provides an opportunity for us to engage in honest and thoughtful discussions about drug use with our families and communities. When dealing with complex issues, such as marijuana policy, no one has all the answers. But as community members, we all have thoughts, feelings, and experiences around drugs and drug use to share with each other. Joining together to explore and share ideas will help us discover how to manage use, as individuals and as a community, in a way that maximizes benefits and minimizes harm.

It's about helping your child develop the skills to assess what can be helpful in achieving their goals in life. It's also about cultivating a supportive relationship, so they know where to address questions or problems. Opening up a discussion about drugs can help strengthen your relationship with your child. Inviting and allowing an open, honest conversation about drugs (or any other topic) lets your child know that what they are thinking, feeling, and experiencing is important to you. The goal is for your child to talk and share their thoughts and feelings. When young people are asked open-ended, insightful questions to explore their thoughts, it helps them become interested in their own thoughts and behaviour. This self-reflection is part of developing critical thinking skills, part of sound decision-making. Critical thinking skills are indeed an essential part of reducing the risks associated with drug use. Once young people have considered something carefully, they are much less likely to act impulsively or to react to influence. There are no rules about how or where to start a conversation about alcohol or other drugs. Even young children know drugs are part of our culture. They see people around them drinking and exposed to drugs on TV and commercials. This makes it a topic that can naturally come up when preparing for a family party involving alcohol, or if you are going to visit a smoking relative, or while exchanging ideas. stories at the dinner table about what happened at work and school that day.

CBD is legal in Canada and has been used in the treatment of various medical conditions. All cannabinoids, including CBD, produce effects in the body by binding to certain receptors in the brain or immune system. The human body also produces its own cannabinoids. It appears that CBD does not attach directly to the receptors. Instead, it directs the body to use more of its own cannabinoid to produce the therapeutic effects associated with CBD. Research shows that CBD can help relieve chronic pain. Sativex is a proprietary drug that combines THC and CBD and may be prescribed for pain associated with multiple sclerosis. There is also some evidence that CBD may be a promising aid for people with opioid use disorders. The researchers noted that CBD reduced a number of symptoms associated with substance use disorders including anxiety, mood-related symptoms, pain, and insomnia. After studying the safety and effectiveness of CBD oil in the treatment of epilepsy, in 2018 the US FDA approved CBD (Epidiolex) as a treatment for two rare conditions characterized by epilepsy. terrible. Other evidence suggests that CBD may be useful in the treatment of schizophrenia, although more research is needed before CBD can be introduced into medical practice. There is some early evidence that CBD may help people in the early stages of Alzheimer's maintain the ability to recognize the faces of people they know, and thus slow the progression of the disease. Again, more research is needed in this area. Because of the way cannabis and its products are metabolized, scientists believe there is a potential for interactions with other drugs, although nothing significant has been documented yet. CBD has been found to be safe in general. Reports from patients indicate that negative drug interactions are uncommon. As with any other treatment, it's important to monitor your CBD use and seek help if you have any problems or have questions or concerns about its use. .

5.0,what is vaping?,vape,"""Vaping"" is the term for the use of a device in which a liquid, usually flavored, is turned into a vapor (hence vaping) and inhaled. A vaping device consists of a mouthpiece, tank or vessel to hold the liquid, a heating element, and a battery to power that part. The liquid is heated to become a mist, which is inhaled through the mouth into the lungs, where the nicotine or marijuana enters the bloodstream. Any remaining breath is exhaled. Vaping devices come in many types, shapes and sizes, known as e-cigarettes, vape pens, vapes, mods, tanks, or electronic hookahs. Vaping liquids (e-liquid, e-juice) include a solvent, usually propylene glycol or glycerol, flavor, and nicotine or marijuana, although it may not contain anything. In British Columbia, you must be 19 years old to purchase e-cigarette products. The number of youth smoking cigarettes has decreased over the past few years, while vaping has increased. E-cigarettes were developed as an alternative to cigarettes. The first devices came out in 2003 and looked like a traditional cigarette. Nicotine vapor contains fewer toxins and other particles than cigarette smoke. Vaping is a less harmful alternative to tobacco, and evidence shows it can help some people quit smoking. Evidence suggests that vaping may not be the gateway to smoking. Although less harmful than smoking, vaping still has potential harms. There is a small exposure to nicotine and possible carcinogens in the vapor. (Carcinogens are substances that have the potential to cause cancer.) Some evidence suggests that young people may not be aware vaping liquids often contain nicotine. Unregulated e-cigarettes and nicotine content in vaping liquids vary significantly between brands. The chemicals, flavorings, and other heavy metals present in vaping liquids have yet to be thoroughly studied. Therefore, long-term health risks from vaping are unknown. More research is needed in these areas. Marketing strategies for vaping products, often on social media, are designed to appeal to young people. A wide variety of flavors are available, especially the fruity and sweet ones, as well as the look and feel of vaping devices that appeal to young people. Young people may see vaping as fun and a way to socialize with friends and 'smoker' in a less harmful way. Taking the time and space to discuss and explore the issues surrounding vaping is an important way we can support young people and indeed support each other in making the right decisions. about whether to vape, when, or how much. We offer ""not too much, not too often and in the context of safety"" as a way to think about the use of any substance. What this means for you might be the place to start talking!

1.0,psychiatric review daily history,psychiatr review daili histori,"The physician must determine whether the patient can provide a history, that is, whether the patient responds to the initial questions coherently. If not, information is sought from family, caregivers, or other sources of information (eg police). Even when a patient is able to communicate, close family members, friends, or caseworker can provide information that the patient missed. Receiving information that is not recommended by a physician does not violate patient confidentiality. Psychiatric assessments, prior treatment, and adherence to previous treatments are reviewed, and records from this care are collected as soon as possible. Conducting an apathetic and hasty interview with closed-ended questions (following a rigid systematic review) often prevents patients from disclosing pertinent information. Follow-up history of current illness with open-ended questions, allowing patients to tell their story in their own words, takes a similar amount of time and allows patients to describe circumstances socially related and reveal emotional responses. The interview should first explore what prompted the need (or desire) for psychiatric evaluation (eg, unwanted or uncomfortable thoughts, undesirable behavior), including includes how much current symptoms affect the patient or interfere with the patient's social functioning, employment, and personal interactions. The interviewer then tries to get a broader view of the patient's personality by looking at significant life events—current and past—and the patient's response to those events ( see table Areas for initial psychiatric evaluation). Psychiatric, medical, social, and developmental history is also considered. Systematic evaluation to check for other symptoms not described in the psychiatric history is important. Focus only on current symptoms to rule out past history and other symptoms that could lead to incorrect primary diagnosis (and thus incorrect treatment) and omission of pathologies. mental illness or other illness. For example, failure to inquire about past manic episodes in a depressed patient could lead to an incorrect diagnosis of major depressive disorder rather than bipolar disorder. Review of previous medical history and systems should include questions about new or recent physical symptoms, diagnoses, and current medications and treatments to identify causes. underlying entity of psychiatric symptoms (eg, COVID-19 may be a cause of anxiety or depression). Table of Initial Mental Assessment Aspects Emerging personality profiles may suggest adaptive (eg, openness to experience, conscientiousness) or maladaptive traits (eg, self-image central, dependent, poor tolerance to frustration) and may show the coping mechanisms used. The interview may reveal obsessions (unwanted and upsetting thoughts or impulses), ritualistic behaviors (excessive, repetitive, purposeful behavior that a person feels). motivated to do) and delusions (fixed false beliefs) and can determine whether stressors are manifesting as physical symptoms (eg, headaches, colic), psychiatric symptoms (eg, phobia, depression) or social behavior (eg, withdrawal behavior, rebellious behavior). Patients should also be asked about attitudes regarding psychiatric treatment, including medication and psychotherapy, so that this information can be incorporated into the treatment plan. The interviewer should determine whether a physical condition or its treatment is causing or worsening the mental condition (see Medical Evaluation of Patients With Psychiatric Symptoms). In addition to the direct effects (eg, symptoms, including psychiatric symptoms), many physical conditions cause a lot of stress and require coping mechanisms to withstand the associated stressors. to this situation. Many patients with severe physical conditions experience some sort of adaptation disorder, and those with underlying mental disorders may become unstable. Observations during an interview can provide evidence of a mental or physical disorder. Body language can reveal evidence of attitudes and feelings that the patient denies. For example, is the patient restless or pacing despite denying anxiety? Does the patient seem sad despite refusing to acknowledge depressed feelings? General manifestations can also provide clues. For example, is the patient clean and tidy? Are there tremors or a sullen face?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such standardized assessments may be used during routine office visits to help screen patients; Such screening can help identify the most important symptoms and provide a basis for measuring response to treatment. However, screening questionnaires are not a substitute for a broader and more detailed mental status check. General presentation should be evaluated for nonverbal signs of underlying medical conditions. For example, a patient's expression can help determine if they are unable to care for themselves (e.g., they appear to be malnourished, or are dressed sloppily or inappropriately for the weather, or have body odor) Can't or doesn't want to follow social norms (eg, they wear socially inappropriate clothing) Have ever used drugs or tried to harm themselves (eg, they smell of alcohol, scars suggest intravenous drug abuse or self-injury) Speech can be assessed by noting spontaneity, syntax, speed, and volume. A depressed patient may speak slowly and softly, while a manic patient may speak rapidly and loudly. Abnormalities such as dysarthria and dysphagia may indicate a somatic cause of mental status changes, such as head injury, stroke, brain tumor, or multiple sclerosis. Emotional expression can be assessed by asking patients to describe their feelings. The patient's voice, posture, hand gestures, and facial expressions are all considered. Mood (patient-reported emotional state) and affect (the patient's emotional state expression as observed by the interviewer) should be assessed. Emotion and range of emotions (i.e., comprehensive and limited) should be taken into account as well as the relevance of emotion to content of thought (eg, patient smiling when discussing a tragic event). carpet). Thinking and perception can be assessed by not only paying attention to what is communicated, but also paying attention to how it is communicated. Abnormal content can take the following forms: Delusions (false, fixed beliefs) Relating ideas (concepts that everyday events have a special or personally important meaning) important or patient-oriented) Obsessions (repetitive, nagging, unwanted and intrusive thoughts, urges, or images) The doctor can assess whether ideas link and direct goal and whether the transition from one thought to another makes sense.

History History of current illness should note the nature of symptoms and their onset, especially whether they are sudden or gradual in onset and whether symptoms are due to other risk factors. possible (eg, injury, illness, timing of initiation or discontinuation of drug or substance use). The clinician should ask whether the patient has had previous episodes of similar symptoms, whether the psychosis has been diagnosed and treated, and in such cases, whether the patient has stopped taking the drug. The systematic review looked for symptoms suggesting possible causes: Vomiting, diarrhea, or both: Dehydration, electrolyte disturbances Palpitations: Hyperthyroidism, drug effects including withdrawal syndrome Polyuria and heavy drinking: Diabetes mellitus Tremor: Parkinson's disease, withdrawal syndrome Difficulty walking or speaking: Multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, stroke Headache: CNS infection, complex migraine , hemorrhage, mass lesion Fever, cough, dyspnea, urinary disturbance, or diarrhea: Systemic infection Weight loss: Infection, cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, hyperthyroidism Paresthesias and weakness : Vitamin deficiency, stroke, demyelinating disease Relapse and remission of neurological symptoms: Multiple sclerosis, vasculitis Medical history should identify chronic physical disorders that may be causing psychiatric symptoms (eg, thyroid, liver, kidney disease, diabetes, HIV infection, or COVID-19 infection). All prescription and over-the-counter medications should be reviewed, and patients should be asked about any alcohol or illicit substance use (dose and timing). Family history of systemic disorders, particularly thyroid disease and multiple sclerosis, should be evaluated. Risk factors for infection (eg, unprotected sex, needle sharing, recent hospitalization, residence in a shared facility) should be taken into account. Physical examination Vital signs are considered, especially fever, tachypnea, hypertension, and tachycardia. Mental status is assessed, particularly for signs of confusion or loss of attention. A comprehensive physical examination, although focusing on signs of infection (eg, meningeal reaction, pulmonary obstruction, flank pain) Neurologic examination (including gait examination and muscle weakness) Endoscopy fundus to detect signs of increased intracranial pressure (eg, papilledema, retinal vein occlusion) Signs of liver disease (eg, jaundice, ascites, angioedema) should be considered . Skin is carefully examined for self-inflicted wounds or other evidence of external trauma (eg, bruises). Interpretation of signs Findings from the history and physical examination help explain possible causes and guide examination and treatment. Confusion and loss of attention (significantly reduced awareness of the environment, suggestive of delirium), especially if sudden onset, fluctuating, or both, indicate the presence of a physical disorder . However, the converse is often not true (i.e. a sensory system clearly does not confirm the cause as a mental disorder). Other findings suggesting a systemic cause include abnormal vital signs (eg, fever, tachycardia, tachypnea) Meningeal signs and symptoms (eg, headache, photophobia, stiff neck) Abnormalities noted during neurologic examination, including aphasia Movement, balance, or both urinary incontinence Some findings help suggest a specific cause possible, especially when symptoms and signs are new or have changed from a relatively stable baseline over a long period of time: Dilated pupils (especially if accompanied by hot, flushed skin, dry): Effects of anticholinergic drugs Shrinking pupils: Opioid effect or pontine hemorrhage slurred speech or inability to speak: A brain injury (eg, stroke) A previous history of relapse - rebound neurologic symptoms, especially when multiple nerves are involved : Multiple sclerosis or vasculitis Sock-type paresthesia: Possible thiamine or vitamin B12 deficiency In patients with hallucinations, the type of hallucinogen is not specific, except for the ordering hallucinations. or voice commentary on the patient's behavior may be psychotic. Symptoms that begin shortly after a serious injury or after starting a new medication may be due to those events.

If a patient with a history of psychosis has worsening symptoms and they have no medical complaints, a normal sensory system and a normal physical exam (including vital signs, pulse oximetry, and finger blood glucose testing), they usually do not require additional laboratory tests other than measuring therapeutic drug levels. Although new-onset psychiatric symptoms or a marked change in the nature of symptoms in patients with known psychosis may be due to pathology rather than psychosis, The prevalence of the disorder is unknown and there is no consensus on routine laboratory testing. of medically asymptomatic patients. Some clinicians do one or more of the following to screen for potential disorders: Complete blood count Serum electrolyte levels (including calcium and magnesium), blood urea, and creatinine Rate erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein, CRP HIV test Urine test Electrolyte and renal function tests can be diagnostic and aid in further medication management (eg, medication to be adjusted in the patient). renal failure). Patients with signs or symptoms of disease should have the appropriate laboratory diagnostic test: CT of the brain: Patients with new-onset psychotic symptoms or delirium, headache, history Recent trauma, or focal neurologic findings (eg, limb weakness) Lumbar puncture: Patients with meningeal signs or with normal CT findings present with fever, pain, and Headache, or delirium Thyroid function tests: Patients taking lithium, those with symptoms or signs of thyroid disease, and those > 40 years of age with new-onset psychiatric symptoms (especially women or patients with a family history of thyroid disease) Chest X-ray: Patients with low oxygen saturation, fever, productive cough or hemoptysis Blood cultures: Severe patients with fever Liver testing: Patients with symptoms or signs of liver disease, history of alcohol or drug abuse, or no documented previous medical history Less often, findings that may suggest testing systemic lupus erythematosus, syphilis, demyelinating disorders, Lyme disease, or thiamin or vitamin B12 deficiency, especially in patients presenting with dementia.

Because patients are often unable or unwilling to provide a clear history, other important sources of information (eg, family members, friends, domestic workers) should be identified and explored immediately. , medical record). Pearls & Pitfalls It should not be assumed that the cause of abnormal behavior is a mental disorder or intoxication, even in patients with a prior psychiatric diagnosis or a taste for alcohol. Clinicians must be aware that violent patients may engage in violent behavior directed toward the treatment team and other patients. Actively violent patients must first be restrained by physical means Drugs (chemical restraint) Both Such interventions are undertaken to prevent harm to the patient and others and allows the cause of the behavior to be assessed (eg, by measuring vital signs and doing blood tests). When the patient is restrained, close monitoring is required, sometimes requiring frequent observation by a trained caregiver. Medically stable patients may be placed in a secure seclusion room. Although clinicians must be aware of the legal issues associated with involuntary treatment (see also Regulatory issues in the use of physical restraints in aggressive patients, violence), such problems should not delay vital interventions. Potentially violent patients require measures to defuse the situation. Measures that may reduce agitation and aggression include Relocating the patient to a calm, quiet environment (eg, a separate room, if available) Removal of objects that may be used to harm self or others Show empathetic concern for the patient and their complaints Respond assertively but supportively Learn what can be done to resolve determine the cause of agitation or aggression Direct speech - show that the patient seems angry or upset, ask them if they intend to hurt someone - acknowledge their feelings and may release information; this does not increase their ability to perform the behavior. Counterproductive measures include Challenging the patient's fears and complaints Making threats (eg, calling the police, putting them in a mental hospital) Speaking condescendingly Attempting to hit tricking patients (eg, hiding medication in food, promising that they will not be restrained) Staff and community safety When hostile and aggressive patients are interviewed, staff safety must be is considered. Most hospitals have a policy of searching for weapons (manual, with metal detectors, or both) on patients with behavioral disorders. When possible, patients should be evaluated in an area with safety features such as security cameras, metal detectors, and interview rooms that can be seen by staff. Hostile but nonviolent patients usually do not randomly attack staff members; instead, they attack employees who are angry or appear to be threatening them. Room door should be left open. Staff can also avoid intimidation by sitting in the same row as the patient. Staff can avoid angering patients by not responding with hostility to angry, loud, or argumentative comments. However, if the patient appears increasingly agitated and violent, staff should simply leave the room and summon additional staff to create a sufficient force, sometimes deterring the patient. Usually, at least 4 or 5 people should be present (in some cases better young people and men). However, workgroups should not bring restraints into the room, unless it is absolutely necessary to use them; obviously restraint can further agitate the patient. Verbal threats must be taken seriously. In most states, when a patient expresses intent to cause harm to a particular person, a physical assessment is required to alert the victim and notify specific law enforcement. Specific requirements vary by state. Often, state regulations also require reporting of child, elder, and spousal abuse.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3.0,the use of restraint by physical means is controversial and should only be considered when other methods have failed and the patient continues to pose a significant danger to self or others.,use restraint physic mean controversi consid method fail patient continu pose signific danger self,"The use of restraint by physical means is controversial and should only be considered when other methods have failed and the patient continues to pose a significant danger to self or others. Restraint may be necessary to hold the patient long enough to administer medication, perform a full evaluation, or both. Because restraint is applied without the patient's consent, certain legal and ethical issues should be considered (see Issues with the regulation of the use of physical measures in patients). aggression, violence). Regulatory issues in the use of physical restraint in patients with aggressive behavior Regulatory issues in the use of physical restraint in patients with aggressive behavior Aggression, violence The use of physical restraint should be considered a last resort, when other steps have not adequately controlled aggressive, potentially violent behaviour. When restraints are necessary for such a situation, they are legal in all states as long as their use is reasonable and properly documented in the patient's medical record. Restraint has the advantage that it can be eliminated immediately, whereas medication can alter symptoms or in a way delay evaluation. The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations Standards on Restraint and Seclusion provides guidance on the use of restraint methods in psychiatric settings. They state that restrictions must be applied under the direction of a licensed physician (LP) who is authorized by hospital policy under state law to do so. The LP must evaluate the patient within the first hour of restraint. The order for continued adult restraint may be written every 4 hours. The patient must be evaluated by an LP or registered nurse within a 4-hour period and before restraint is continued. After the minimum period of time prescribed by state law and no longer than 24 hours, the LP must reevaluate the patient in person before continuing with the restraining order. Children 9-17 years of age must be evaluated every 2 hours and those < 9 years of age, every hour. Hospital licensing standards require restrained patients to be continuously observed by a trained caregiver. Immediately after applying restraint, the patient should be monitored for signs of injury; Circulation, exercise, nutrition and water intake, vital signs, hygiene and excretion should also be monitored. Physical and mental comfort as well as readiness to discontinue restraint when appropriate were also assessed. These assessments should be done every 15 minutes. Seclusion and restraint should be used simultaneously only in exceptional circumstances and with ongoing supervision. Restraints are used to Prevent obvious, impending harm to the patient or others Prevent interruption of a patient's medical treatment (e.g. tug of the infusion line or infusion bottle) when consent is obtained. Convenience for treatment Prevent physical damage to surroundings, staff, or other patients Prevent patients requiring treatment from involuntarily escaping (when a locked room is not available) Restraints should not be used for Punishment purposes Convenience of staff (eg, to avoid patient wandering) Caution should be exercised in suicidal patients who may use restraint as a means of committing suicide. Procedure Restrictions should only be applied by personnel fully trained in correct techniques and protecting patient rights and safety. First, staff are assembled in the room, and the patient is informed that restraint must be put in place. Patients are encouraged to cooperate to avoid resistance. However, once the clinician has determined that restraint is required, there is no negotiation and the patient is told to apply restraint whether or not they agree. Some people really understand and think there should be external limits to their behavior. To prepare for the application of restraints, each person will be in charge of one limb and another person will be in charge of the patient's head. Then, each person simultaneously grasps the assigned limb and places the patient supine on the bed; A person in good physical condition can often partially control the limbs even of tall, violent patients (all limbs are controlled at the same time). However, one more person is needed to apply restraint measures. Rarely, extremely aggressive patients may need to first be sandwiched between 2 mattresses. The leather strap restraint is preferred. The restraint is applied to each ankle and wrist and attached to the bed frame, not to the armrests. Prohibited restraint must not be applied around the chest, neck, or head, and around the mouth (for example, to prevent spitting and swearing). Patients who continue to be aggressive when restrained (eg, trying to hit, bite, or spit) require chemical restraint. Complications Agitators or violent people brought to the hospital by the police are almost always restrained (eg handcuffs). Sometimes, young, healthy people have died in police restraint before or shortly after arriving at the hospital. The cause is often unclear but may be related to a combination of subsequent metabolic disturbances and hyperthermia, drug use, inhalation of substances from the stomach into the respiratory system, pulmonary embolism. people who are restrained for a long time and which can sometimes be associated with potentially serious medical disorders. Death is more common if the patient is restrained in a difficult position, with one or two wrists cuffed to the ankle in the back; This type of restraint can cause suffocation and should be avoided. Because of these complications, violent patients incarcerated in police stations should be evaluated quickly and thoroughly and should not be left alone for social behavior problems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Anxiety is very uncomfortable. Anxiety affects function. Anxiety does not stop spontaneously occurring for several days.

Such panic attacks are called anticipatory attacks. Unforeseen panic attacks are spontaneous occurrences without any obvious triggers. Most people with panic disorder anticipate and worry about an episode (anxiety about what's coming) and avoid places or situations where they've had a panic attack in the past. People with panic disorder often worry that they have a serious heart, lung, or brain problem and often visit their GP or the emergency room for help.

In other cases, especially without treatment, panic disorder comes on after prolonged ups and downs of symptoms. Patients should be told that treatment will usually help control symptoms. If avoidant behaviors are not available, reassurance, anxiety education, and encouragement to continue to return and stay where the panic attacks occurred may be all that needs to be done. However, for a persistent disorder that involves frequent panic attacks and avoidance behaviors, treatment will likely require drug therapy combined with more intensive psychotherapy.

The first-line psychotherapy used, exposure therapy, involves exposure to situations that the person avoids because they may trigger flashbacks of the trauma. Repeatedly imaginary exposure to one's own traumatic experience often alleviates distress after some initial increase in discomfort. Eye-ball motion reperception and desensitization (EMDR) is a form of exposure therapy. For this therapy, patients are asked to follow the therapist's moving finger while they imagine being exposed to the trauma. Stopping certain ritualistic behaviors, such as excessive washing to feel clean after sexual assault, also helps. SSRIs can reduce anxiety and/or depression. Prazosin seems to be helpful in reducing nightmares. Mood stabilizers and atypical antipsychotics are also sometimes prescribed, but support from their use is scant. Because anxiety is often intense, supportive psychotherapy plays an important role.

Misrepresentational symptoms include Feeling detached from surroundings (eg, people, objects, things), which seem unrealistic Patients may feel as though they are inside a dream or fog or as if a wall of glass or curtain separates them from their surroundings. The world seems lifeless, colorless or artificial. Subjective distortions of the world are common. For example, objects may appear blurry or unclear as usual; they appear to be flat or smaller or larger than themselves. The sound seems louder or softer; Time seems to go by too slow or too fast. Symptoms are almost always bothersome, and when severe, intolerable. Anxiety and depression are common. Some patients are concerned that they have irreversible brain damage or that they are slowly going insane. Others obsess over whether they really exist or constantly test to determine if their perception is real. However, patients always retain the perception that their unrealistic experiences are not real but just the way they feel (i.e. they still have the ability to check reality). This recognition helps to distinguish depersonalization/misperception disorders from psychotic disorders in which inner understanding is consistently lacking.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Behavioral techniques can help patients engage in tasks that disengage them from depersonalization and misperception of reality. Grounding techniques use the five senses (eg, by playing loud music or placing a bandage in the hand) to help patients feel more connected to themselves and the world and feel more real in those moments. there. Psychodynamic therapy helps patients deal with negative emotions, underlying conflicts, or experiences that cause self-intolerance and dissociation. Timing and impact labeling and dissociation during therapy sessions work well for some patients. Many drugs have been used, but none have been able to demonstrate a clear effect. However, some patients can be helped with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), lamotrigine, opioid antagonists, anxiolytics, and stimulants.

Forgetting can be Localization Selective Pervasive Rarely, dissociative forgetfulness is accompanied by purposeful travel or aimless wandering, known as running away (from the Latin fugere, ""to hide"" run""). Partial amnesia refers to the inability to recall a particular event or events or a particular period of time; These memory gaps are often associated with trauma or stress. For example, the patient may forget months or years of abuse as a child or days during intense combat. This forgetting may not manifest for hours, days, or longer after the traumatic period. Usually, the forgotten time period, which can range from minutes to decades, is clearly demarcated. Typically, patients experience one or more episodes of dementia. Selective forgetting involves forgetting only certain events over a certain period of time or only part of a traumatic event. Patients may have both local and selective amnesia. In pervasive forgetfulness, patients forget their identity and background – for example, who they are, where they have gone, who they have talked to, and what they do, say, think, experience, and feel see. Some patients are no longer able to perform well-learned skills and lose established information about the world. Diffuse dissociation is rare; it is more common in combat veterans, those who have been sexually assaulted, and those experiencing extreme stress or conflict. Onset is usually sudden. In systematic amnesia, the patient forgets information about a particular category, such as all information about a particular person or about their family. In continuous amnesia, the patient forgets each new event as it occurs. Most patients are partially or completely unaware that they have gaps in their memory. They only learn when their personal identity is lost or when circumstances make them known—for example, when others speak or ask them about events they cannot remember. Patients seem to become confused as soon as they are forgotten. Many people suffer greatly, but there are also those who do not see a difference. If people who don't recognize their forgetting seek psychiatric help, they do so for other reasons. Patients have difficulty forming and maintaining relationships. Some patients say they have flashbacks, as occurs in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); Recollections can alternate with forgetting by their contents. Some patients develop PTSD later, especially when they realize traumatic or stressful events caused their amnesia. Depressive and neuropsychiatric symptoms are common, as are suicidal and other self-destructive behaviors. The risk of suicidal behaviors may be increased when the sudden forgetfulness is resolved and the patient is overwhelmed by memories of the trauma. Dissociative evasion is an uncommon phenomenon that sometimes occurs in dissociative forgetfulness. Dissociative runaway often manifests as Sudden, unexpected, intentional departure from home on purpose Wandering without direction Patient, losing their identity and habits, leaving home and work. A runaway can last from a few hours to several months, sometimes longer. If the bout is short, they may appear to have simply missed some work or come home late. If the runaway lasts a few days or longer, they may move away from home, assume a new name and identity, and start a new job, unaware of any changes in their lives. their life. Many bouts of running away appear to represent the fulfillment of a hidden wish or just an authorized way out of severe suffering or embarrassment, especially among those with a high salary. rigid mind. For example, a financially distressed executive leaves his busy life and lives as a farmer in the country. During the runaway, the patient may appear and function normally or be only slightly confused. However, when the runaway ended, the patient said to suddenly find himself in the new situation and have no memory of how they came to be there or what they were doing. They often feel embarrassed, upset, grieving, and/or depressed. Some are scared, especially if they can't remember what happened during the run away. These manifestations may lead them to think about medical or legal authorities. Most people can recall their identities and lives, although recall can be a lengthy process; a few do not or barely talk about their hazy past.

Treatment for more severe dementia begins with creating a safe and supportive environment. This measure alone often leads to a gradual recovery of lost memories. When this is not possible or the need to restore memories is urgent, questioning the patient while they are under hypnosis, or rarely, a drug-induced semi-hypnosis (barbiturates or benzodiazepines) can be success. These strategies must be taken lightly because the traumatic settings that cause dementia are almost certainly recallable and traumatic. The questioner must be careful to phrase the questions so as not to suggest the existence of a fact and to avoid the risk of creating a false memory. Patients with abuse, especially in childhood, may expect therapists to exploit or abuse them and to impose unpleasant memories rather than helping them recall actual memories. injury). The accuracy of memories restored by such strategies can only be determined by external confirmation. However, regardless of the accuracy of the history, filling in these gaps as much as possible is often helpful in restoring the patient's identity continuum and self-perception and in creating a cohesive life story. Once amnesia is lifted, treatment helps with the following: Give meaning to the underlying trauma or underlying conflict Resolve issues related to the amnesia Allow the patient to continue their lives If the patient has experienced dissociative escapism, psychotherapy, sometimes combined with hypnosis or drug-assisted interviews, can be used to restore memory; These efforts are often unsuccessful.

Children are not born with a sense of a unified identity; it evolved from many sources and experiences. In children who are overwhelmed, many parts that should have come together are still separated. Severe and prolonged abuse (physical, sexual, emotional) and neglect during childhood are commonly reported and documented in patients with fecal identity disorder (in the US, Canada, and Europe, about 90% of patients). Some patients are not abused but have experienced a significant early loss (such as a death of a parent), serious illness, or other intensely stressful events. Contrary to most children who have a continuous, complex assessment of themselves and others, severely abused children can go through stages in which perceptions, memories, and feelings about their experiences are segregated. This is exacerbated by parents or other caregivers exhibiting inconsistent behavior (eg, alternating between cuddling and abusive behaviors) in a pattern known as betrayal trauma. Over time, those children may develop the ability to escape abuse either by ""walking away"" - that is, by separating from their harsh environment - or by withdrawing into their own minds. Each developmental stage or traumatic experience can be used to create a different identity. On standardized tests, people with this disorder score high on hypnosis and dissociation (the ability to separate memories, perceptions, or identities from conscious perception).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Multiple identities In the possessed form, multiple identities appear conspicuously to family members and co-workers. The patient speaks and acts in a distinctly different way, as if a person or being had taken over. The new identity may be that of another person (usually a deceased person, perhaps in a dramatic phase) or of a supernatural spirit (usually a demon or god) who may claim the punishment for past actions. In the unpossessed form the various identities are usually not obvious to the observer. Instead, the patient feels depersonalized; that is, they feel unreal, excluded from themselves, and disconnected from their physical and mental processes. Patients say they feel like an observer of their lives, as if they are watching themselves in a movie over which they have no control (personal loss). They may think that their body feels different (for example, like that of a small child or of the opposite sex) and doesn't belong to them. They may have unexpected thoughts, impulses, and emotions that don't seem to belong to them and may manifest as confusing thought currents or as voices. Some expressions are recognizable by the observer. For example, a patient's attitudes, opinions, and preferences (eg, about food, clothing, or preferences) may suddenly change, then change again. People with dissociative identity disorder also experience interference with their daily activities when there is a change in identity or interference of one identity state in the functioning of another identity. For example, at work, an angry identity might suddenly shout at a colleague or boss. Dementia Patients often have dissociative amnesia.

Diagnosis requires specific knowledge and questions about dissociative phenomena. Prolonged, hypnotic, or drug-assisted interviews (barbiturates or benzodiazepines) are sometimes used, and patients may be asked to keep a journal between visits. All of these measures involve efforts to bring about a change of identity during the assessment process. The clinician may attempt to map out the different identities and their relationships. Specially designed structured interviews and questionnaires can be very helpful, especially for clinicians with little experience with this disorder. The clinician may also attempt to directly relate to other identities by asking to speak about the part of the mind involved in behaviors that the patient cannot remember or appears to be doing by the person. Hypnosis can help clinicians access dissociated states and other identities and give patients greater control over transitions between dissociated states.

The drug is widely used to help control symptoms of depression, anxiety, impulsivity, and substance abuse but does not reduce dissociation. Treatment to achieve unity lies at the heart of psychotherapy. For patients who cannot or will not struggle to integrate, treatment aims to facilitate co-operation and cooperation between identities and to relieve symptoms. Psychotherapy's first priority is to stabilize the patient and ensure safety, before assessing traumatic experiences and exploring problematic identities and reasons for dissociation. Some patients benefit from a hospital stay, in which ongoing support and supervision are provided as painful memories resolve. Therapists should be vigilant in helping such patients avoid re-mistreatment. Hypnosis can help access identities, facilitate communication between them, and stabilize and understand them. Some therapists engage and interact directly with dissociated identity states in an effort to facilitate integration of identity states (1). Improved exposure techniques can be used to desensitize patients to traumatic memories, sometimes tolerated only in small memory fragments. Since the reasons for the dissociation are addressed and implemented, therapy can work toward connecting, integrating, and restoring the patient's surrogate selves, relationships, and social functioning. Some integration occurs spontaneously during treatment. Immersion may be encouraged by negotiating and aligning identities or may be facilitated by the use of hypnotic hints and guided imagery. Trauma patients, especially in childhood, may desire further abuse during treatment and develop complex transitional responses to their therapist. Discussing these understandable feelings is an important part of effective psychotherapy. Treatment References 1.

When weight loss is severe or rapid, or when weight falls below 75% of normal weight, weight loss becomes critical and requires hospital treatment. If there is any doubt, the patient should be hospitalized. Outpatient treatment can include a variety of support and supervision and often includes a team of facilitators. Nutritional supplements are often used with behavioral therapy that has a clear goal of weight recovery. Nutritional supplementation, starting with about 30 to 40 kcal/kg/day, can lead to weight gain of up to 1.5 kg/week during inpatient care and 0.5 kg/week during outpatient care. reside. Feeding solid foods by mouth is best; Many weight recovery plans also use liquid supplements. Patients with low resistance, malnutrition sometimes need to feed by nasogastric tube. Calcium 1200 to 1500 mg/day and vitamin D 600 to 800 IU/day are commonly prescribed for bone loss. Once nutritional, fluid, and electrolyte status have been stabilized, initiate long-term therapy. Outpatient psychotherapy is the cornerstone of treatment. Treatments should emphasize behavioral outcomes such as normal eating and weight gain. Treatment should continue for one year after weight is restored. Outcomes are best in adolescents with the disorder < 6 months. Family therapy, especially using the Maudsley model (also known as family-based therapy), is helpful for adolescents. This model has 3 stages: Family members are taught how to refeed the teen (eg, through supervised family meals) and thus restore the teen's weight (in contrast to the previous approach, this model does not blame families or adolescents). Controlling eating is gradually reintroduced to the adolescent. After the adolescent is able to maintain the recovered weight, therapy focuses on creating a healthy adolescent identity. Treatment of anorexia nervosa is complicated by the patient's fear of weight gain and denial of the illness. The physician should strive to create a slow, caring, and steady relationship while encouraging reasonable intake of food. Treatment also includes regular follow-up and often a team of health care professionals, including a dietitian, who can provide specific meal plans or information about needed calories. to restore normal weight.

The amount of food consumed during a bulimia can vary widely, sometimes reaching thousands of calories. Binge eating tends to be episodic, often triggered by psychosocial stress, can occur as often as several times a day, and is often done in secret. Binge eating is accompanied by compensatory behaviors: self-induced vomiting, use of laxatives or diuretics, excessive exercise, and/or fasting. Patients are usually of normal weight; a minority are overweight or obese. However, patients are overly concerned with their body weight and/or shape; they are often not satisfied with their body and think they need to lose weight. Patients with bulimia nervosa are more likely to acknowledge or repent or blame for their behavior than those with anorexia nervosa and are more likely to acknowledge their concerns when asked by a sympathetic doctor. They are also less socially isolated and more prone to hyperactive behavior, drug and alcohol abuse, and depression. Depression, anxiety (eg, related to weight and/or social situation) and anxiety disorders were more common in these patients.

5.0,bipolar disorders symptoms and signs of bipolar disorder,bipolar disord symptom sign bipolar disord,"Bipolar disorder begins with an acute period of symptoms, followed by a repeated cycle of remission and relapse. Remission is usually complete, but many patients have residual symptoms, and for some, their ability to function in the workplace is severely impaired. Relapses are separate episodes of more intense symptoms, that is, mania, depression, mild depression, or a mixture of depressive and manic traits. Training sessions last from a few weeks to 3 to 6 months; Depressive episodes usually last longer than manic or depressive episodes. The cycles – the time from the onset of one episode to the onset of the next – vary among patients. Some patients have infrequent periods, perhaps only a few episodes throughout life, while others have rapid cyclic patterns (usually defined as ≥4 periods/year). Only a few patients alternate between mania and depression in each cycle; In most cases, one pole or the other predominates. The patient may attempt suicide or commit suicide. The lifetime rate of acquired suicide in patients with bipolar disorder is estimated to be at least 15 times that of the general population. Manic episode A manic episode is defined as ≥ 1 week with persistently elevated, expansive, or excitable moods and persistent increases in purposeful activity or noticeable energy surges plus 3 symptoms : Increased or exaggerated self-esteem Decreased need for sleep Talks more than usual Distracted or fast-paced thinking Easily distracted Increased purposeful activities Excessive participation in activities high-risk activities (eg, heavy purchases, foolish business investments) Manic patients may tirelessly engage in many pleasurable, high-risk activities, and impulses (eg, gambling, dangerous sports, ostentatious acts) without understanding the potential harm. Symptoms are so severe that they are unable to function in key roles (career, school, housekeeper). Unwise investments, spending and other personal choices can have irreparable consequences. Patients in a manic episode may dress brightly and often speak at a rapid, unstoppable rate. The patient can make associations (new thoughts are triggered by sounds instead of word meanings). Easily distracted, the patient may constantly switch from one topic to another. However, they tend to believe that they are at their best. Lack of understanding and increased functioning often leads to intrusive behavior and can be a dangerous combination. Discord is interpersonal and can make the patient feel they are being treated or mistreated. As a result, the patient may become a danger to himself or to others. Increased mental activity is perceived by patients as rushing thinking and observed as discursive thinking by the physician's assessment. Psychotic mania is a more severe manifestation, with psychotic symptoms that can be difficult to distinguish from schizophrenia. The patient has exaggerated delusions or is being watched (eg, about being Jesus or being followed by the FBI), occasionally hallucinating. Activity level increased markedly; The patient may drive fast and scream, swear, or sing. Increased emotional instability, often increased excitability. Delirium (manic delirium) may occur, with complete loss of thought and behavior. Hypomanic episode A hypomanic episode is a less severe variant of mania involving a distinct episode lasting 4 days with markedly different behavior from the patient's normally nondepressive self. and includes ≥ 3 of the additional symptoms listed above under mania. During the hypomanic episode, the mood is bright, the need for sleep decreases with a marked increase in energy, and psychomotor agitation rapidly increases. For some patients, hypomanic episodes are adaptive because they produce more energy, increased creativity, confidence, and supernormal social functioning. Many people don't want to leave their happy, euphoric state. Some performed quite well, and performance was not significantly impaired.

A diagnosis of bipolar I disorder requires symptoms severe enough to significantly impair social or occupational functioning or hospitalization to prevent harm to self or others. Some patients with depressive symptoms may have had a previous experience of hypomania or mania but do not respond to it, unless they are specifically questioned. Skilled questioning may reveal signs of disease presence (eg, overspending, ostentatious impulses, substance abuse), although such information is more likely to be provided by relatives. A structured statement like the Mood Disorders Questionnaire can be helpful. All patients should be asked gently but directly about suicidal ideation, plan, or behavior. Symptoms similar to acute mania or hypomania may occur as a result of stimulant use or physical disorders such as hyperthyroidism or pheochromocytoma. Patients with hyperthyroidism often have other symptoms and physical signs, but thyroid function tests (T4 and TSH) are a reasonable evaluation test for new patients. Patients with pheochromocytoma have markedly intermittent or persistent hypertension; If hypertension is not present, there is no indication for testing for pheochromocytoma. Other disorders are less likely to cause manic symptoms, but depressive symptoms can occur in some disorders (see table Some Causes of Depression and Mania). A review of substance use (especially amphetamines and cocaine) and blood or urine substance testing can help identify a substance's cause. However, because substance use can simply trigger an episode in patients with bipolar disorder, it is important to look for symptoms (manic or depressive) that are not related to drug use. important. Some patients with schizophrenia have manic symptoms, but these patients have psychotic manifestations that may persist beyond episodes of abnormal mood.

If relapses occur during maintenance therapy, the clinician should determine the extent of compliance, and if so, whether that non-adherence precedes or precedes disease-stage recurrence. The reasons for the lack of compliance should be sought to determine whether a change in mood medication is necessary or a change in dosage that would make the treatment more acceptable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3.0,lithium bipolar disorder drug treatment,lithium bipolar disord drug treatment,"Up to two-thirds of patients with uncomplicated bipolar disorder respond to lithium, which reduces bipolar mood swings but does not affect normal mood. Patients with a typical family history of bipolar disorder are more likely to respond to lithium. Whether lithium or other mood stabilizers are being used, there can be significant changes in patients with mixed, rapid forms of bipolar disorder (usually defined as ≥4 episodes/year ), co-occurring anxiety, substance abuse, or neurological disorders. Lithium carbonate was initiated at 300 mg orally 2 or 3 times/day and titrated, based on steady-state blood levels and tolerability, to range from 0.8 to 1.2 mEq/L ( 0.8 to 1.2 mmol/L). Concentrations should be withdrawn 5 days after the steady-state dose and 12 hours after the last dose. The target drug concentration for maintenance is lower, about 0.6 to 0.7 mEq/L (0.6 to 0.7 mmol/L). Higher maintenance concentrations are protective against manic (but not depressive) episodes but have more adverse effects. For adolescents, the age group with good glomerular function requires higher doses; Elderly patients need lower dosages. Lithium can induce sedation and cognitive impairment directly or indirectly (causing hypothyroidism) and often aggravate acne and psoriasis. The most common mild, acute side effects were shakiness, fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, polyuria, increased thirst, and weight gain (in part due to drinking high-calorie beverages). These effects are usually transient and usually respond to slight dose reductions, divided doses (eg, 3 times daily), or the use of delayed-release formulations. Once the dose has been determined, the entire dose should be given after the evening meal. This once-daily dosing may improve compliance and possibly reduce nephrotoxicity. A beta-blocker (eg, atenolol 25 to 50 mg orally once a day) can control severe tremors; however, some beta blockers (eg, propranolol) can make depression worse. Acute lithium poisoning is initially manifested by generalized tremor, increased deep tendon reflexes, persistent headache, vomiting, and confusion and may progress to lethargy, convulsions, and arrhythmias. Poisoning is more likely to occur in the following situations: Elderly patients Patients with reduced creatinine clearance People with sodium loss (eg, due to fever, vomiting, diarrhea, or diuretic use). ) Thiazide diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in addition to aspirin may contribute to increased arrhythmias. Blood lithium levels should be measured every 6 months and whenever the dosage is changed. Long-term side effects of lithium include Hyperthyroidism, especially when there is a family history of hyperthyroidism. Renal damage involving the distal tubules which occurs after ≥ 15 years of lithium treatment Therefore, it is advisable to monitor Check TSH levels at the start of lithium therapy and annually thereafter if there is a family history of thyroid dysfunction, or retest annually for all other patients. Levels should also be measured whenever symptoms suggest thyroid dysfunction (including when mania recurs) because hypothyroidism can counteract the effects of mood stabilizers. Blood urea and creatinine should be measured prior to use, 2 or 3 times within the first 6 months, and then once or twice a year. Cumulative dose is a risk factor for kidney injury, so the minimum dose should be used for effective prophylaxis (1–3). Lithium References 1.

3.0,treatment with bipolar disorder anticonvulsants,treatment bipolar disord anticonvuls,"Antiepileptic drugs that act as mood stabilizers, especially valproate and carbamazepine, are commonly used for acute mania and mixed states (manic and depressive episodes). Lamotrigine is effective for cyclical mood swings and depression. The exact mechanism of action for antiepileptic drugs in bipolar disorder is unknown but may involve the gamma-aminobutyric acid mechanism and ultimately the G-protein signaling system. Their main advantages over lithium include their broader therapeutic spectrum and lack of nephrotoxicity. For valproate, a loading dose of 20 to 30 mg/kg is used, then 250 to 500 mg orally 3 times a day (slow release may be used); Target blood concentrations are between 50 and 125 mcg/mL (347 and 867 micromol/L). This approach does not cause more side effects than gradual titration. Adverse effects include nausea, headache, sedation, dizziness, and weight gain; Rare serious effects include hepatotoxicity and pancreatitis. Carbamazepine should not be taken in high doses in the first place; should be started at 200 mg orally twice daily and increased in increments of 200 mg/day at a target level of 4 to 12 mcg/mL (17 and 51 micromol/L; maximum, 800 mg twice/day) day). Adverse effects include nausea, dizziness, malaise, and loss of balance. Very serious effects include anemia due to hypoplasia and agranulocytosis. Lamotrigine is initiated at 25 mg orally once/day for 2 weeks, then 50 mg once/day for 2 weeks, then 100 mg/day for 1 week, and then can be increased by 50 mg weekly as needed up to 200 mg once/day. Dosage was lower in patients receiving valproate and higher in patients receiving carbamazepine. Lamotrigine can cause a rash and can also be life-threatening such as Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, especially if the dose is increased faster than recommended. While taking lamotrigine, patients should be encouraged to respond to rashes, papules, fever, gland swelling, mouth sores, eyes, and swelling of the lips or tongue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3.0,drug treatment for bipolar disorder antipsychotic drugs,drug treatment bipolar disord antipsychot drug,"Acute manic episodes with psychosis are increasingly being managed by 2nd generation antipsychotics, such as Aripiprazole (10 to 30 mg orally once a day) Cariprazine (1.5 to 3.0 mg once a day) /day) Lurasidone (20 to 120 mg once daily) Olanzapine (usually 5 to 10 mg orally twice a day) Quetiapine (200 to 400 mg orally twice a day) Risperidone (usually 2 to 3 mg orally twice a day) Ziprasidone (40 to 80 mg orally twice a day) In addition, there is evidence that these agents may enhance the effects of mood stabilizers after the acute phase. Although any of these drugs can have extrapyramidal side effects and cause restlessness, that risk is less with sedatives such as quetiapine and olanzapine. Less immediate adverse effects include significant weight gain and the development of the metabolic syndrome (including weight gain, excessive abdominal fat, insulin resistance and dyslipidemia); The risk may be lower with the least sedating second-generation antipsychotics, ziprasidone and aripiprazole. For severely hyperactive psychotic patients with nutritional deficiencies (eating, drinking), an intramuscular neuroleptic plus supportive care supplemented with lithium or an antiepileptic drug may be beneficial. effective.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3.0,drug treatment for bipolar disorder precautions during pregnancy,drug treatment bipolar disord precaut pregnanc,"Lithium use during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular malformations (especially Ebstein's malformation). However, the absolute risk of this malformation is quite low. Lithium use during pregnancy appears to increase the relative risk of birth defects by about 2-fold, similar to a 2- to 3-fold increase in the risk of birth defects associated with carbamazepine or lamotrigine use and lower significantly compared with the risk associated with valproate use. With valproate, the risk of neural tube defects and other birth defects is 2 to 7 times greater than with other common antiepileptic drugs. Valproate increases the risk of neural tube defects, congenital heart defects, genital abnormalities, musculoskeletal system abnormalities, and cleft lip or cleft palate. In addition, thinking levels (eg, IQ scores) were reduced in children of women taking valproate during pregnancy compared with other anticonvulsants; dose-related risk. Valproate also increases the risk of ADHD and autism spectrum disorders (1). Extensive studies of the use of first-generation antipsychotics and tricyclic antidepressants in early pregnancy have not revealed causes for concern. There is evidence that 2nd-generation antipsychotics are safe as well with the possible exception of risperidone (2). The same goes for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), with the exception of paroxetin. Data on the risks of second-generation antipsychotics to the fetus are unclear, although these agents are widely used for all episodes of bipolar disorder. Using medications (especially lithium and SSRIs) before birth can have a postpartum effect on the newborn. Treatment decisions are often complicated by the fact that in an unplanned pregnancy, a teratogenic effect may already be present by the time the physician becomes aware of the problem. Consideration should be given to consultation with a psychiatrist with expertise in childbirth. In all cases, it is important to discuss the risks and benefits of treatment with the patient.

5.0,cyclic mood disorder treatment of cyclic bipolar disorder,cyclic mood disord treatment cyclic bipolar disord,"Supportive care Sometimes a mood stabilizer is needed. Patients should be taught how to live with their personality tendencies; however, living with cyclical mood disorder is not easy because interpersonal relationships are often turbulent. Work with flexible hours is recommended. The artistically inclined patient may perhaps be encouraged to pursue a career in the arts because the excessiveness and vulnerability of the mood disorder person can be well tolerated here. The decision to use a mood stabilizer (eg, lithium; specific antiepileptic drugs, especially valproate, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine) depends on the balance between functional impairment and social benefit or exacerbation creativity that patients can experience. Divalproex 500 to 1000 mg orally once a day is generally better tolerated than equivalent doses of lithium. Antidepressants should be avoided unless depressive symptoms are severe and persistent because of the high risk of phase reversal and rapid cycling. Support groups can help patients by providing a forum to share their shared experiences and feelings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the more standard terms for such moods are dismay and mourning. Negative feelings of dismay and grief, unlike those with depression, do the following: Occur in waves that tend to be associated with thoughts or reminders of the event Resolve when circumstances or improved events May alternate with periods of positive emotions Not accompanied by feelings of worthlessness and self-loathing Decreased mood often lasting for days rather than weeks or months, and suicidal thoughts and prolonged loss of function is less likely. However, events and stressors that cause dismay and grief can also trigger a major depressive episode, particularly in vulnerable individuals (eg, those with a history or history of depression). depressive family).

5.0,depressive disorders causes of depressive disorders,depress disord caus depress disord,"The exact cause of depressive disorders is unclear, but there are genetic and environmental contributions. Heredity accounts for about half of the etiology (less in late-onset depression). Thus, depression is more common among first-degree relatives of depressed patients, and is consistent with identical twins. With that, genetic factors can influence the development of a depressive response to adverse events. Other theories focus on altered levels of neurotransmitters, including abnormal regulation of cholinergic, catecholaminergic (noradrenergic or dopaminergic), and serotonergic (5-hydroxytryptamine (1)) neurotransmitters. Neuroendocrine dysregulation may be a factor, with particular focus on 3 axes: hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal, hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroidal, and hypothalamic-pituitary growth hormone Psychosocial factors also seem to be involved Major life stresses, especially separation and major loss, often precede episodes of major depression; however , such events do not usually cause lasting, severe depression except in people with a predisposition to mood disorders.Persons with one major depressive episode are at higher risk of further episodes. People who are less resilient and/or who are prone to anxiety may be at risk of developing a depressive disorder.Such people often do not develop the social skills to cope with the pressures of life. The presence of other psychiatric disorders increases the risk of major depressive disorder. Women are at higher risk, but there is no theory as to why. Factors may include: Greater exposure or strong response to daily stress Higher levels of monoamine oxidase (an enzyme that plays a role in reducing neurotransmitters considered important for mood) Higher rates of thyroid dysfunction Hormonal changes that occur with menstruation and menopause In postpartum depression, symptoms develop during pregnancy or within 4 weeks of giving birth (postpartum depression); Endocrine changes have been shown to be involved, but the specific cause is unknown. In seasonal affective disorder, symptoms develop seasonally, typically in the fall or winter; The disorder tends to occur in climates with long or severe winters. Depressive symptoms or disturbances that may be associated with other physical disorders, including thyroid disorders, adrenal gland disorders, benign or malignant brain tumors, stroke, AIDS, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis (see table Some Causes of Depressive and Manic Symptoms). Certain medications, such as corticosteroids, some beta-blockers, interferon, and reserpine, can also lead to depressive disorders. Abuse of certain recreational substances (eg, alcohol, amphetamines) can lead to or be accompanied by depression. Toxic effects or withdrawal may cause temporary depressive symptoms.

People with depressive disorder often have suicidal thoughts and may attempt suicide. Other psychiatric symptoms or disturbances (eg, anxiety and panic attacks) often coexist, sometimes complicating diagnosis and treatment. Patients with all forms of depression are more likely to abuse alcohol or other recreational drugs in an attempt to self-treat their sleep disturbance or anxiety symptoms; however, depression is a less common cause of alcohol use disorders and other substance use disorders than previously thought. Patients also tend to become heavy smokers and neglect their health, increasing their risk of developing or progressing other disorders (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]). Depression can decrease the body's protective immune response. Depression increases the risk of cardiovascular disorders, myocardial infarction (EYE) and stroke, possibly because depression, cytokines and other clotting factors are elevated and heart rate variability decreased - all potential risk factors for cardiovascular disorders. Typical depression (unipolar disorder) Patients may appear distressed, drooping eyes, furrowed eyebrows, lower corners of the mouth, drooping posture, poor eye contact, lack of facial expression facial expressions, limited body movements, and voice changes (eg, soft voice, lack of intimacy, use of monosyllabic words). The appearance can be mistaken for Parkinson's disease. In some patients, the mood is so low that the tears are dry; They report that they are unable to experience common emotions and feel that the world has become colorless and lifeless. Nutrition can be severely impaired, requiring immediate intervention. Some depressed patients don't pay attention to personal hygiene or even their children, other loved ones, or pets. For a diagnosis of major depression, 5 of the following symptoms must be present nearly every day for the same 2 week period, and one of them must be low mood or loss of interests: Low mood mostly during the day Decreased interest or enjoyment in all or nearly all activities for most of the day Significant weight gain (> 5%) or weight loss or increased appetite Insomnia (often patterned insomnia) waking up in the middle of the night) or somnolence Agitation or psychomotor retardation observed by others (not self-reported) Fatigue or loss of energy Excessive feelings of worthlessness or guilt or inadequacy Impaired ability to think or concentrate or indecision Repetitive thoughts about death or suicide, suicide attempts, or a specific plan to commit suicide Persistent depressive disorder Symptoms depression lasting 2 years without remission is classified as persistent depressive disorder (PDD), a category that merges disorders formerly known as chronic major depressive disorder and dysthymia sharp. Symptoms usually begin insidiously during adolescence and may persist for years or decades. The number of symptoms often fluctuates above and below the threshold of typical depression. Affected patients may often be gloomy, pessimistic, humorous, passive, apathetic, introverted, overly judgmental of themselves or others, and complaining. Patients with PDD are also more likely to have an underlying anxiety disorder, substance use disorder, or personality disorder (eg, borderline personality disorder). To be diagnosed with persistent depressive disorder, the patient must have low mood on most days for ≥ 2 years plus ≥ 2 of the following symptoms: Anorexia or overeating Insomnia or oversleeping A lot of decreased energy or fatigue Low self-esteem Poor concentration or difficulty making decisions Feelings of hopelessness Premenstrual dysphoric disorder Premenstrual dysphoric disorder associated with mood symptoms and anxiety that are clearly related to the menstrual cycle, with onset during the premenstrual period and the asymptomatic period after menstruation. Symptoms must have been present during most of the menstrual cycle in the past year. Manifestations are similar to those of premenstrual syndrome but are more severe, causing clinically significant distress and/or significant impairment in social or occupational functioning. The disorder can begin any time after the first onset of menstruation; it may be worse as in menopause but will stop after menopause. Prevalence is estimated at 2 to 6% in women's menstrual cycle over a 12-month period.

Specific closed-ended questions help identify patients with symptoms required by the DSM-5 criteria for the diagnosis of major depression. To help distinguish depressive disorder from normal mood swings, there must be significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other significant areas of functioning. Severity is determined by pain and disability (physical, social, occupational) and by symptom duration. The physician should gently but directly ask the patient about any thoughts and plans with the intent of harming self or others, any threats and/suicide, and other risk factors. . Psychosis and dystonia suggest major depression. Melancholy features suggest severe or moderate depression. Co-existing physical problems, substance use disorders, and anxiety disorders can increase severity. Differential Diagnosis Depressive disorders should be distinguished from dismay and grief. Other psychiatric disorders (eg, anxiety disorders) may mimic or mask a diagnosis of depression. Sometimes more than one disorder is present. Typical depression (unipolar disorder) must be distinguished from bipolar disorder. In elderly patients, depression may present as dementia (formerly known as pseudodementia), causing many symptoms and signs of dementia such as mental retardation and impaired concentration. . However, early dementia can cause depression. In general, when the diagnosis is uncertain, treatment for the depressive disorder is recommended. Distinguishing persistent depressive disorders from substance use disorder disorders, such as mood disorders, can be difficult, especially because they can coexist and can aggravate each other's status.

Other psychiatric disorders (eg, anxiety disorders) may mimic or mask a diagnosis of depression. Sometimes more than one disorder is present. Typical depression (unipolar disorder) must be distinguished from bipolar disorder. In elderly patients, depression may present as dementia (formerly known as pseudodementia), causing many symptoms and signs of dementia such as mental retardation and impaired concentration. . However, early dementia can cause depression. In general, when the diagnosis is uncertain, treatment for the depressive disorder is recommended.

Symptoms may resolve spontaneously, especially when symptoms are mild or of short duration. Mild depression can be treated with general support and psychotherapy. Moderate to severe depression is treated with medication, psychotherapy, or both and sometimes with electroshock therapy. Some patients require a combination of drugs. Improvement may not be apparent until after 1 to 4 weeks of drug treatment. Depression, especially in patients who have had > 1 episode, is likely to recur; therefore, severe cases often require long-term maintenance therapy. Most people with depression are treated as outpatients. Patients with significant suicidal ideation, especially when there is a lack of family support, require hospitalization, as well as those with psychiatric symptoms or physical impairments. In patients with substance use disorders, depressive symptoms often resolve within a few months of stopping substance use. Antidepressant treatment is less effective while substance use continues. If a systemic disorder or toxic drug may be the cause, the underlying disorder must first be treated directly. However, if the diagnosis is in doubt or if symptoms are unclear or include suicidal ideation or feelings of hopelessness, a trial of treatment with an antidepressant or a mood stabilizer may be helpful. Persistent grief disorder may benefit from psychotherapy specific to the disorder. Initial Support Until visible improvement begins, the physician may need to see the patient weekly or biweekly for support and education and monitoring of progress. Calling can be helpful for rescheduled appointments. Patients and loved ones may be concerned or hesitant about having a mental disorder. Your doctor can help explain that depression is a serious medical disorder caused by a biological disorder and requires specific treatment and that the prognosis is good. Patients and loved ones need to be reassured that depression is not a reflection of a bad character (eg, laziness, weakness). Telling patients that the path to recovery often fluctuates, this helps them realize hopelessness is just personal opinion and can help them improve adherence to treatment. Encouraging the patient to gradually increase simple activities (eg, walking, regular exercise) and social interaction must be balanced with recognition of a desire to avoid activities. The doctor may suggest that the patient avoid self-blame and explain that dark thoughts are part of the disorder and will go away. Psychotherapy Many controlled trials have shown that psychotherapy, especially cognitive behavioral therapy and interpersonal therapy, is effective in patients with major depressive disorder, both in terms of treatment of acute symptoms and to reduce the likelihood of recurrence. Patients with mild depression tend to have better outcomes than patients with more severe depression, but the spectrum of improvement is higher in those with more severe depression. Medications for depression Several medications and medications may be used to treat depression: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) Serotonin regulators (5-HT2 blockers) Reuptake inhibitors Serotonin-norepinephrine collection Norepinephrin-dopamine reuptake inhibitors Heterocyclic antidepressants Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) Melatonergic antidepressants Ketamine-like drugs Drug selection can be based on prior response to a specific antidepressant. Otherwise, an SSRI is usually the initial drug of choice. Although different SSRIs are equally effective in typical cases, certain properties of the drugs make them more or less appropriate for some patients (see table Antidepressants). Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) ECT involves inducing electrical convulsions under controlled conditions. Its mechanism of action is uncertain but the induction of convulsive activity seems to be integral to its antidepressant effects. Modern ECT, given in the presence of severe sedation/general anesthesia, is generally well tolerated but confusion and memory impairment can be severe. Most of this improves and resolves by 6 months after a course of ECT, but retrograde amnesia can persist for a long time. This is especially true for memories from several months before ECT. Patients with cognitive impairment at baseline, those treated for bilateral epilepsy, elderly patients, and patients taking lithium are at increased risk for memory impairment and confusion. The following are often treated with ECT if medication is not effective: Major depression with suicide Depression with agitation or mental retardation Paranoid depression Depression during pregnancy Patient resists eating may need ECT to prevent death. ECT is particularly effective for psychotic depression. The response to 6 to 10 ECT treatments is usually good and can improve for the patient. Recurrence after ECT is common, and drug therapy is usually maintained after ECT is discontinued. Phototherapy Light therapy is best known for seasonal depression but seems to be as effective as non-seasonal depression. Home treatment can be provided with a special light device that provides 2500 to 10,000 lux at a distance of 30 to 60 cm that the patient can see for 30 to 60 minutes/day (longer with light source). less intense light). In patients who go to bed late at night and wake up late in the morning, light therapy is most effective in the morning, sometimes supplemented with 5 to 10 minutes of exposure between 3 p.m. and 3 p.m. 7 pm. For patients who go to bed and wake up early, light therapy is most effective between 3pm and 7pm. Other therapies Psychostimulants (eg, dextroamphetamine, methylphenidate) are sometimes used, usually with antidepressants. Several controlled trials support their use in depressive disorders (1). Herbal medicine is used for some patients. St.John's grass may be effective for mild depression, although data are conflicting. St.John's herbs can interact with antidepressants and other medications. Several controlled studies of the use of omega-3 supplements, used to enhance the efficacy of primary or monotherapy, have shown that eicosapentaenoic acid 1 to 2 g once daily has a beneficial effect against depression . Vagus nerve stimulation involves rhythmically stimulating the vagus nerve through an implanted pulse generator. It may be more helpful for treatment-resistant depression than other treatments, but it usually takes 3 to 6 months to be effective. The use of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for the acute treatment of major depressive disorder has had significant support from controlled trials. Low frequency rTMS can be applied to the right prefrontal cortex (DLPC) and high frequency rTMS can be applied to the left DLPC. The most common side effects are headache and scalp discomfort; both occur more often when using higher frequencies than low frequency rTMS frequencies. Deep brain stimulation using implantable electrodes targeting the inferior iliac gyrus or anterior abdominal/striatal corpus callosum has had positive results in an uncontrolled clinical series (2). Controlled trials are underway. Support groups (eg, the Bipolar and Depression Patient Support Alliance [DBSA]) can help patients by providing a forum to share their shared experiences and feelings.

Some analysis of the FDA database of industry-sponsored trials has resulted in a ""black box"" warning that antidepressants in general are associated with an increased risk of developing depression. suicidal ideation and suicide in patients ≤ 24 years of age. Subsequent FDA analysis and other data cast doubt on this conclusion (1).

3.0,drug treatment of depression selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris),drug treatment depress select serotonin reuptak inhibitor ssri,"These drugs prevent the reuptake of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]). SSRIs include citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetin, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, and vilazodone. Although these agents share the same mechanism of action, their differences in clinical properties make selection important. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have a wide therapeutic range; they are relatively easy to use, requiring little dose adjustment (with the exception of fluvoxamine). By preventing reuptake of presynaptic 5-HT, SSRIs result in greater 5-HT stimulation of postsynaptic 5-HT receptors. SSRIs are selective for the 5-HT system but not specific for various 5-HT receptors. Drugs that stimulate 5-HT1 receptors, have antidepressant and anxiolytic effects, but also stimulate 5-HT2 receptors often causing anxiety, insomnia, sexual dysfunction, and 5-receptors HT3 often causes nausea and headaches. So, paradoxically, SSRIs can reduce and induce anxiety. Some patients may experience increased agitation, depression, and anxiety within a week of starting an SSRI or increasing the dose. Sexual dysfunction (especially difficulty reaching orgasm but also decreased libido and erectile dysfunction) occurs in one third or more of patients. Some SSRIs cause weight gain. Others, especially fluoxetin, can cause loss of appetite for the first few months. SSRIs have little anticholinergic, anti-adrenergic, and cardiac conduction effects. The sedating effect is usually minimal or non-existent, but during the first weeks of treatment, some patients tend to be sleepy during the day. Loose stools or diarrhea occur in some patients. Drug interactions are relatively uncommon; however, fluoxetin, paroxetin, and fluvoxamine can inhibit cytochrome P-450 (CYP450) enzymes, which can lead to serious drug interactions. For example, these drugs may inhibit the metabolism of some beta-blockers, including propranolol and metoprolol, which can lead to hypotension and bradycardia. Discontinuation symptoms (eg, irritability, anxiety, nausea) may occur if the drug is stopped suddenly; Such effects are less likely with fluoxetine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Serotonin Regulators Including Trazodone Mirtazapine Serotonin Regulators have antidepressant and anxiolytic effects but do not cause sexual dysfunction. Trazodone has caused prolonged erection (1/1000) and, as an alpha-1 noradrenergic blocker, may cause orthostatic (postural) hypotension. It is very calming, so its use in antidepressant dosages (>200 mg/day) is limited. The drug is usually given at a dose of 50 to 100 mg at bedtime for patients with insomnia. Mirtazapine is a 5-HT antagonist and blocks alpha-2 adrenergic autoreceptors, as well as 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 receptors. The result is increased serotonergic function and increased noradrenergic function without sexual dysfunction or nausea. It has no cardiac side effects, has few interactions with drug-metabolizing liver enzymes, and is generally well-tolerated, although it causes sleep and weight gain, which is H1-mediated (histamine).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Heterocyclic antidepressants can rapidly increase norepinephrine and to some extent 5-HT by blocking reuptake at the synaptic cleft. Prolonged use downregulates postsynaptic membrane alpha-1 receptors – a possible common final pathway of their antidepressant activity. Although effective, these drugs are now rarely used because overdoses are toxic and they have more side effects than other antidepressants. The more common side effects of heterocyclics are due to muscarinic inhibition, histamine blocking, and alpha-1 adrenolytic activities. Many heterodimers have potent anticholinergic properties and are therefore unsuitable for the elderly and for patients with benign prostatic hypertrophy, glaucoma, or chronic constipation. All heterocyclics, especially maprotiline and clomipramine, lower the threshold for seizures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3.0,treat depression with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (maoi),treat depress monoamin oxidas inhibitor maoi,"These drugs inhibit the oxidative amine degradation of 3 biogenic amines (norepinephrine, dopamine, 5-HT) and other phenylethylamines. The primary value of these drugs is in the treatment of refractory or atypical depression when selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), tricyclic antidepressants, and sometimes even Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is not effective. The circulating monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) as antidepressants in the US (eg, phenelzin, tranylcypromine, isocarboxazid) are irreversible and non-selective (MAO-A and MAO-B inhibitors). Another MAOI (selegilin), which inhibits only MAO-B at low doses, is available in patch form. An acute hypertensive crisis may occur if an MAOI that inhibits MAO-A and MAO-B is given with a sympathomimetic or food containing tyramine or dopamine. This effect is called the cheese reaction because ripe cheeses are high in tyramine. MAOIs are used infrequently because of concerns about this reaction. Lower doses of the selegiline patch are considered safe when used without specific dietary restrictions, unless the dose must be higher than the starting dose (6 mg patch). Selective and reversible MAOIs (eg, moclobemide, befloxatone), which inhibit MAO-A, are relatively free of these interactions but are absent in the US. To prevent hypertensive crisis and acute hyperthermia, patients taking MAOIs should avoid sympathomimetic drugs (eg, pseudoephedrine), dextromethorphan, reserpine, and meperidin, as well as malt ales, chianti, and sherry. (wine originating in southern Spain), liqueurs, cooked or aged foods containing tyramine or dopamine (for example, broad beans, yeast extract, canned figs, raisins, yogurt, cheese, sour cream, soy sauce, salmon, caviar, liver, banana peel, tender meat). Patients can take chlorpromazine 25 mg and, as soon as signs of a hypertensive reaction occur, take 1 or 2 tablets when they go to the nearest emergency room. Common side effects of MAOIs include erectile dysfunction (less common with tranylcypromine), anxiety, nausea, dizziness, insomnia, pulmonary edema, and weight gain. MAOIs should not be taken with other antidepressants, and at least 2 weeks (5 weeks with fluoxetine, which has a long half-life) should be stopped between the two drugs. MAOIs used with antidepressants that affect the 5-HT system (eg, SSRIs) can cause serotonin syndrome (a potentially life-threatening condition in which patients may exhibit altered altered mental status, hyperthermia, and autonomic and neuromuscular hyperactivity). Patients taking MAOIs and those requiring anti-asthmatics or anti-allergics, local or general anesthesia must be treated by a psychiatrist along with an internist, dentist, or anesthesiologist. with expertise in psychopharmacology.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3.0,treat depression with ketamine-like drugs,treat depress ketaminelik drug,"Numerous studies have shown that, rather than sedation, ketamine doses often produce rapid resolution of depressive symptoms in patients with major depressive disorder. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently released a guideline for the use of esketamine, the s-enantiomer of ketamine, in this population. The putative mechanism of action of ketamine under anesthesia is of particular interest because it is not primarily related to the activity of monoamine receptors as is the case with nearly all other approved antidepressants. Instead, the effects are thought to begin with blockade of the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) glutamate-releasing receptor. This, in turn, increases brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BNF) synthesis, and through the activation of both mammalian targets rapamycine (mTOR) and alpha acid. -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazoleproprionic (AMPA), leading to a rapid increase in dendritic spine density in specific pyramidal cells affected by chronic stress and increased cortisolemia . Most patients take a dose of an antidepressant that improves their symptoms of depression in 3 to 4 hours and then, in most cases, gradually subsides over the next 1 to 2 weeks. Multiple treatments over several weeks prolong the time of improvement, but the recurrence rate is high in the following months. Many ketamine clinics adjust the intervals between treatments, and some patients are able to maintain improvement with only monthly treatments. Side effects are usually limited to 1 to 2 days hours after administration and included malformations, hypertension, nausea, and vomiting. Because ketamine has a well-known potential for abuse, it should be administered in a hospital or hospital setting. The starting dose is 0.5 mg/kg for intravenous ketamine or 56 mg for intranasal esketamine. There is no evidence of increased efficacy for doses above 0.5 mg/kg for intravenous ketamine. The therapeutic range for intranasal esketamine is 56 to 84 mg. Patients should be monitored in the clinic for 2 hours after taking the drug and advised not to drive until the next day. Acute hypertension may require intervention.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3.0,drug treatment of depression with drugs selection and management,drug treatment depress drug select manag,"Drug selection can be based on previous response to a particular antidepressant. Otherwise, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) is usually the initial drug of choice. Although different SSRIs are equally effective in typical cases, certain properties of the drugs make them more or less appropriate for some patients (see table Antidepressants). Table of Antidepressants If an SSRI is not effective, another SSRI may be substituted, or an antidepressant of a different class may be considered. Tranylcypromin 20 to 30 mg orally twice a day is effective for treatment-resistant depression after trials of other antidepressants; it should be given by a physician experienced in the use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). Psychological support of patients and loved ones is especially important in treatment-resistant cases. Insomnia, a common side effect of SSRIs, is treated by reducing the dose, giving it in the morning, or adding a low dose of trazodone or another sedative antidepressant at bedtime. Nausea and loose stools usually resolve at first, but the throbbing headache doesn't always go away, which leads to a change in medication. An SSRI should be stopped if it causes agitation. When decreased libido, impotence, or inability to achieve orgasm during treatment with an SSRI, reducing the dose or changing to a serotonin regulator or norepinephrin-dopamine reuptake inhibitor may help. SSRIs tend to be activated in depressed patients and should be given in the morning. Taking a full dose of a heterocyclic antidepressant at bedtime often avoids unnecessary sedation, minimizes side effects during the day, and improves compliance. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) are usually taken in the morning and early afternoon to avoid overstimulation. With most antidepressants, a response to treatment usually occurs in 2 to 3 weeks (sometimes as early as 4 days or as late as 8 weeks). For a first episode of mild or moderate depression, antidepressants should be given for 6 months, then tapered off gradually over 2 months. If the episode is severe or recurrent or if there is a risk of suicide, the dose that induces complete remission should be continued as the maintenance dose. For depression with psychotic symptoms, a combination of antidepressants and antipsychotics is more effective than used alone. Patients who have recovered from psychotic depression have a higher risk of relapse than those with non-psychotic depression, so prevention is especially important. Continued antidepressant treatment for 6 to 12 months (up to 2 years in patients > 50) is usually necessary to prevent relapse. Most antidepressants, especially SSRIs, should be tapered off (by about 25%/week) rather than abruptly stopped; Abrupt discontinuation of SSRIs can lead to discontinuation syndrome (nausea, chills, myalgia, dizziness, anxiety, irritability, insomnia, fatigue). The likelihood and severity of withdrawal is inversely correlated with the half-life of SSRIs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5.0,obsessive-compulsive disorder (ocd) symptoms and signs of ocd,obsessivecompuls disord ocd symptom sign ocd,"Obsessions are unwanted, intrusive thoughts, urges, or images, the presence of which often causes marked distress or anxiety. The main theme of obsessive thoughts can be harm, danger to self or others, pollution, doubt, symmetry, or aggression. For example, patients may obsess about contamination or germs unless they wash their hands for ≥ 2 hours/day. Obsessions are unpleasant experiences. As a result, patients often attempt to ignore and/or suppress thoughts, urges, or images. Or they try to disable them by performing ritualistic acts. Rituals (often called compulsions) are excessive, repetitive, and intentional behaviors that affected individuals feel they must do to prevent or reduce anxiety caused by obsessive thoughts their pictures or to ease their obsession. Examples: Wash (eg, wash hands, shower), Check (e.g. check if the stove is off, the door is locked) Count (eg, repeat the behavior a certain number of times) ) Sorting (for example, arranging tableware or workspace items in a particular order) Most rituals, such as washing hands or checking locks, can be observable, but some mental rituals, such as silent repetitions of counting or muttering under the breath, are not observable. Often, forced rituals must be performed precisely according to rigid rules. The rituals may or may not be actually connected to the feared events. When connected realistically (e.g., shower for dirt, check the stove for fire), the ritual is clearly overdone - for example, showering for hours a day or always checking the stove 30 times a day. before leaving the house. In all cases, the obsessions and/or compulsions are time consuming (eg, 1 hour per day, often more) or cause the patient significant distress or functional impairment; At extremes, obsessions and compulsions can be disabling. The level of understanding is different. Most people with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) realize to some extent that their underlying beliefs are unrealistic (for example, they really won't get cancer). if touching an ashtray). Occasionally, however, there is a complete lack of understanding (i.e. the patient is convinced that the beliefs underlying their obsessions are true and that their ritual behavior is justified).

For example, a patient with a contamination obsession and a compulsion to wash may be asked to touch a toilet seat without washing their hands. This approach allows for the activation of contact anxiety and subsequent reduction of anxiety through habit. Improvement often lasts many years, especially in patients who have grasped the approach and use it even after formal treatment ends. However, some patients have an inadequate response (as well as to some drugs). Cognitive therapy techniques (eg, cognitive restructuring) may also be helpful in targeting some of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder. Some antidepressants, including SSRIs and clomipramine (tricyclic antidepressants with serotonergic effects) are often very effective.

Although intensity can vary, the disorder is usually considered chronic unless the patient is treated appropriately. Concerns usually involve the face or head area but can include any part of the body or any part of an organ and can vary from part to part over time. For example, patients may worry about less hair, acne, wrinkles, scars, vascular spots, skin color, or too much facial or body hair. Or they may focus on the shape or size of the nose, eyes, ears, mouth, chest, buttocks, legs, or other body part. Men (and rarely women) can have a form of the disorder called dysmorphic muscle disorder, which involves preoccupation with the idea that their bodies aren't muscular enough. Patients may describe body parts they dislike as ugly, unattractive, disfigured, disgusting, or bizarre. Patients often spend many hours of the day worrying about their perceived impairments and often mistakenly believe that people are specifically taking notice or ridiculing them for these perceived impairments. They look at themselves often in the mirror, others avoid looking in the mirror, and still others alternate between the two behaviors. Other common compulsive behaviors include comparing their appearance to others, excessive grooming, skin pinching (to remove or correct perceived skin defects), hair pulling or pulling, seek reassurance (about perceived defects) and change clothes. Most try to disguise such flaws—for example, by growing a beard to hide a scar or by wearing a hat to hide thinning hair. Many people undergo dermatological, dental, surgical, or other cosmetic treatments to correct their perceived defects, but such treatment is often unsuccessful and can raise concerns. their. Men with dysmorphic muscle disorders may use androgen supplements, which can be dangerous. Because people with body dysmorphic disorder have a sense of self-consciousness about their appearance, they may avoid going out in public. For the most part, their social, occupational, academic and other aspects of functioning are often impaired – often because of their anxiety about appearance. Some only leave the house at night; others, don't go out all day. Social isolation, depression, hospitalization, and suicidal behavior are common. In some very severe cases, body dysmorphic disorder causes loss of mobility. The degree of understanding varies, but is often little or no understanding. That is, most patients truly believe that the unwanted body part may (with little understanding) or certainly (no insight) appear unusual, ugly, or unattractive. Over the course of their lives, about 80% of people with appearance dysmorphic disorder have suicidal thoughts and about one-quarter to nearly 30% attempt suicide (see Suicidal Behavior). Appearance dysmorphic disorder is characterized by significantly higher levels of suicide than other psychiatric disorders (1) with a high risk of suicide. References on signs and symptoms 1.

Many patients attempt to disguise skin lesions with clothing or makeup. Skin tugging can be accompanied by a variety of behaviors or rituals. Patients can look closely for specific areas of scaly skin to scratch; they may try to ensure that these scaly areas are pinched in a particular way (by using fingers or tools) and may bite or swallow the scab after it is removed. Patients with dermatophytosis repeatedly try to stop pinching the skin or pinching the skin less often, but they are unable to do so. The patient may feel embarrassed or ashamed about the appearance of the site where the skin is pricked. As a result, patients can avoid social situations where skin lesions can be seen by others; they don't usually pinch their skin in front of other people, except perhaps family members. Patients may be impaired in other areas of functioning (eg, occupational, academic), mainly because they avoid social situations. Some patients can pick up someone else's skin.

The patient accumulates a large number of objects without enough space; Objects clog and clutter the living space to the point where large areas become unusable, except for storing objects. For example, hoarded newspapers can fill the sink and cover the kitchen countertops and ovens, rendering these areas unusable for meal prep. Hoarding symptoms often impair social, occupational, or other areas of functioning. For example, patients may not allow others, including family members, friends, and repairmen to enter their home because they feel embarrassed by the mess. Hoarding can lead to unsafe living conditions (for example, by creating a fire hazard or increasing the risk of falls) and can lead to eviction or legal problems.

Other concerns include smelling urine, bloating from the anus, or an unpleasant odor from the genital area. Sometimes patients believe they emit odors such as garbage or rancid food. Preoccupation with body odor is often accompanied by repetitive behaviors (eg, smelling oneself, bathing too much, changing clothes, seeking reassurance); These behaviors attempt to significantly alleviate the anxiety caused by concerns about body odor. Most people with olfactory disorders also attempt to disguise perceived odors (eg, with perfumes, deodorants, mouthwashes, chewing gum). Vision is often poor or absent (i.e. most people think they can or definitely emit unpleasant body odors when they are not). Very few people realize that their beliefs about body odor are incorrect, possibly because many people with olfactory disorders report that they actually smelled it themselves. A seizure disorder such as temporal lobe epilepsy should be considered and ruled out if symptoms suggest a possible presence of the disorder. Referential thinking is common; For example, patients may incorrectly believe that their body odor is the reason people sit away from them, open windows, or cover their noses.

Tools include penile volume variability (men), vaginal volume radiography (women), and normalized pornography viewing time; however, possession of such material, even for diagnostic purposes, may be illegal under certain laws. The clinical criteria for the diagnosis (based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition [DSM-5]) of pedophilia are provocative behaviors, impulses, or fantasies. intense, recurrent sex involving a pre-adolescent or child (usually ≤ 13 years) present for a period of ≥ 6 months.

Child sexual abuse treatment is less effective when required by the court, although many tried sex offenders have benefited from treatments, such as group psychotherapy and other treatments. antiandrogen drugs. Some people with pedophilia are afraid to commit to treatment and supervision, which can curb their child sex abuse and be reintegrated into society. These results were more favorable in the absence of other psychiatric disorders, particularly personality disorders. Drugs In the United States, the treatment of choice for hypogonadism in children is Medroxyprogesterone acetate intramuscularly.

Serum testosterone levels should be monitored and maintained within the female normal range (<62 ng/dL [2.15 nmol/L]) in male patients. Treatment is often protracted because distorted fantasies often recur many weeks after stopping treatment. Liver function tests should be performed, and blood pressure, bone density, and total blood analysis should be ordered. The usefulness of antidepressants in hypogonadal females in children is less well known.

More sophisticated and experimental diagnostic tools are available to more specialized clinical professionals. A diagnosis of a personality disorder requires the following: A persistent, inflexible, intrusive pattern of maladaptive characteristics associated with 2 of the following: cognitive (ways or perceptions and interpretations of self, others, and events), emotionality, interpersonal functioning, and impulse control Significant discomfort or impairment as a result from morphological maladaptive Relative stability and early onset (within at least adolescence or early adulthood) of the model In addition, other causes for the this symptom (eg, other mental health disorder, substance use, head injury).

Disregard for the pain of others in childhood is associated with antisocial behavior in later adolescence. Antisocial personality disorder is more common among first-degree relatives of patients than in the general population. The risk of developing this disorder is increased in both adopted children and children born to parents with the disorder. If conduct disorder with ADHD develops before age 10, the risk of developing antisocial personality disorder in adulthood is increased.

They may shy away from meetings. They avoid making new friends unless they are sure they will be liked. These patients assume that humans will be very strict and will not accept until rigorous tests prove otherwise. Therefore, before joining a group and forming close relationships, patients with this disorder often require repeated reassurances of support and non-critical acceptance. Patients with a personality disorder avoid long-term social interaction but are afraid to put their happiness in the hands of others. Because these patients limit their interactions with others, they tend to be relatively isolated and do not have a social network that can help them when they need it. These patients are very sensitive to anything that is slightly critical, disapproving, or mocking because they are constantly thinking about being criticized or rejected by others. They are on the lookout for any sign of negative reactions towards them. Their nervousness can be inferred from ridicule or teasing, thus seeming to confirm their self-doubt. Low self-esteem and feelings of inadequacy preclude these patients in social situations, especially with new people. Interactions with new people are inhibited because patients perceive themselves as socially inferior, unattractive, and inferior to others. They tend to be quiet and shy and try to disappear because they tend to think that if they say anything, other people will say it is wrong. They do not want to talk about themselves for fear that they will be ridiculed or humiliated. They worry that they will blush or cry when they are criticized. Patients with avoidant personality disorder are reluctant to put themselves in at-risk situations or engage in new activities for similar reasons.

5.0,borderline personality disorder (bpd) symptoms and signs of bpd,borderlin person disord bpd symptom sign bpd,"When people with borderline personality disorder feel that they are being abandoned or neglected, they feel intense fear or anger. For example, they may become panicked or angry when someone important to them arrives a few minutes late or cancels a commitment. They think this abandonment means they are bad people. They fear being abandoned partly because they don't want to be alone. These patients tend to change their views of others instantaneously and abruptly. They may idealize a potential carer or lover in the early stages of a relationship, which entails spending a lot of time together, and sharing everything. Suddenly, they may feel that the person is not paying enough attention, and they become disillusioned; they may then look down on or become angry with the person. The shift from idealization to disdain reflects a black-and-white way of thinking (dividing, polarizing between good and bad). Patients with borderline personality disorder can empathize and care for one person but only if they feel that another person will be there for them whenever needed. Patients with this disorder have difficulty controlling their anger and often become inappropriate and intensely angry. They may express their anger by being sarcastic, harsh, or angry, often directed at their caregivers or loved ones for neglecting or abandoning them. After the outburst, they often feel ashamed and guilty, reinforcing their sense of evil. Patients with borderline personality disorder may also suddenly change their self-image, manifesting by abrupt changes in their goals, values, opinions, career, or friends. They may feel miserable for one minute and immediately become angry at being mistreated. Although they often feel bad, they sometimes feel that they don't exist anymore—for example, when they have no one to take care of. They often feel empty inside. Changes in mood (eg, irritability, arousal, anxiety) usually last only a few hours and rarely more than a few days; they may reflect extreme sensitivity to interpersonal tensions in patients with borderline personality disorder. Patients with borderline personality disorder often sabotage themselves when they are about to achieve their goals. For example, they may drop out of school just before graduation, or they may ruin a promising relationship. Impulses that lead to self-harm are common. These patients may gamble, engage in unsafe sexual activities, binge eat, drive recklessly, abuse substances, or overspend. Behaviors, gestures, and threats of suicide and self-mutilation (eg, cutting, burning) are common. Although many of these self-destructive actions are not intended to end life, the risk of suicide in these patients is 40 times greater than in the general population. About 8 to 10% of these patients die by suicide. These self-destructive behaviors are often triggered by rejection, possibly abandonment, or disappointment by a caregiver or lover. Patients may self-mutilate to compensate for their bad feelings, to reassert their sensory abilities during dissociative episodes, or to distract from painful emotions. Episodes of dissociation, paranoid thoughts, and sometimes psychotic-like symptoms (eg, hallucinations, ideas of association) can be triggered by excessive stress, often fear of abandonment , whether real or imaginary. These symptoms are temporary and are usually not severe enough to be considered a separate disorder. Symptoms abate in most patients; low recurrence rate.

Psychotherapy The primary treatment for borderline personality disorder is psychotherapy. Many psychotherapeutic interventions are effective in reducing suicidal behaviors, improving depression, and improving functioning in patients with this disorder. Cognitive-behavioral therapy focuses on emotional dysregulation and lack of social skills. Therapy includes the following: Dialectical Behavior Therapy (combining individual and group sessions with therapists as behavioral training and available by phone) Training system for emotion prediction and problem solving (STEPPS) STEPPS includes weekly group sessions for 20 weeks. Patients are taught skills to manage their emotions, challenge their negative desires, and to take better care of themselves. They learn how to set goals, avoid illegal substances, and improve their eating, sleeping, and exercise habits. Patients were asked to identify a support group of friends, family members, and healthcare practitioners who were available to coach them when they were in crisis. Other interventions focus on disturbances in the way patients experience emotions about themselves and others. These interventions include: Psychotherapy based on psychiatry, Psychotherapy that focuses on movement, Therapy that focuses on the schema, Psychotherapy, which refers to the person's ability to reflect and understand their state of mind. mental state of themselves and others. Mentalization is believed to be learned through a secure attachment to the caregiver. Psychotherapy-based therapy helps patients do the following: Effectively regulate their emotions (eg, calm down when angry) Understand their own contribution to problems and problems their problems with others Reflect and understand the mental state of others Thus helping them relate to others with empathy and compassion. Psychotherapy with a focus on mobility focuses on the interaction between the patient and the therapist. The therapist asks questions and helps the patient think about their response so they can examine their exaggerated, distorted, and unrealistic image during the session. The present moment (eg, how the patient relates to their therapist) is emphasized rather than the past. For example, when a shy, quiet patient suddenly becomes hostile and argumentative, the therapist might ask if the patient has noticed a change in emotions and then ask the patient to think about it. about how the patient is experiencing the therapist and about themselves as things change. The goal is to Enable the patient to develop a more stable and realistic sense of self and others Have a healthier relationship with others through a referral to a therapist Focused therapy schemata is a treatment that combines cognitive-behavioral therapy, attachment theory, psychodynamic concepts, and emotion-focused therapies. Therapy focuses on thought patterns, feelings, maladaptive and coping behaviors (called schemas), emotion-changing techniques, and therapeutic relationships. Limiting parenting involves establishing a secure attachment between the patient and the therapist (within professional limits), allowing the therapist to help the patient experience what the patient has left behind. missed in childhood leads to maladaptive behavior. The goal is to help patients change their schemas. Therapy has 3 phases: Evaluation: Identifying schemas Cognitive: Recognizing schemas as they work in everyday life Behavioral Change: Replacing negative thoughts, feelings, and behaviors with healthier thoughts, feelings, and behaviors Some of these interventions are highly specialized and require specialized training and supervision. However, some interventions do not have that specificity; One such intervention, designed with GPs in mind, is General (or good) Psychiatric Management Good Psychological Management including individual therapy once a week, psychoanalysis of the disorder borderline personality and treatment goals and expectations, and sometimes medication. It focuses on the patient's responses to stressors in everyday life. Supportive psychotherapy also works. The goal is to establish an emotional, encouraging, supportive relationship with the patient and thus help the patient develop healthy defense mechanisms, especially in interpersonal relationships. Drugs Drugs work best when used appropriately and systematically for specific symptoms. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are generally well tolerated; The possibility of a fatal overdose is negligible. However, SSRIs are only mildly effective for depression and anxiety in patients with borderline personality disorder.

They often hold someone else, often one person, in charge of many aspects of their life. For example, they may depend on their spouse on what to wear, what kind of work to look for, and who to match. These patients consider themselves inferior and tend to belittle their abilities; they use any criticism or disapproval as proof of their incompetence, further reducing their confidence. It is difficult for them to express disagreement with others because they fear losing their support or approval. They may agree to what they know is wrong rather than risk losing the help of others. Even when anger is appropriate, they don't get angry at friends and colleagues for fear of losing their support. Because these patients are certain that they cannot do anything alone, they have difficulty starting a new task and working independently, and they avoid tasks that require responsibility. They see themselves as incompetent and in need of help and reassurance. When it is assured that competent people are supervising and approving them, these patients tend to perform well. However, they don't want to appear too competent to be left out. As a result, their careers can be damaged. They maintain their dependence because they often tend not to learn independent living skills. These patients are willing to do anything to get care and support (eg, do unpleasant tasks, submit to unreasonable demands, endure physical abuse, sexual or emotional). Being alone makes them feel very uncomfortable or scared because they fear they won't be able to take care of themselves.

However, they may say that the lack of relationships makes them unhappy. They are very nervous in social situations, especially with unfamiliar people. Spending more time in a situation does not reduce their anxiety. These patients often incorrectly interpret common events as having special meaning to them (idea of association). They may be superstitious or think they have special mysterious powers that allow them to sense events before they happen or to read other people's minds. They may think they have magical control over others, think they make others do ordinary things (for example, feed dogs), or perform preventable magical rituals. harmful effects (e.g. washing your hands three times can prevent illness). Language can be weird. It may be too abstract or too specific or contain odd phrases or use phrases or words in an unusual way.

5.0,antipsychotics typical antipsychotics,antipsychot typic antipsychot,"Typical antipsychotics (see table Traditional Antipsychotics) primarily work by blocking dopamine 2 receptors (dopamine-2 blockers). Typical antipsychotics can be classified as high, moderate, or low potency. Highly potent antipsychotics have higher affinity for dopamine receptors and less for alpha-adrenergic and muscarinic receptors. Rarely used, low potency antipsychotics with little affinity for dopamine receptors and relatively greater affinity for alpha-adrenergic, muscarinic and histamine receptors. Various drugs are available in standard tablets, liquids, and both short-acting and long-acting intramuscular injections. A specific drug is selected primarily on the basis of the following: Undesirable effects Route of dosing requirements Prior patient response to the drug Conventional antipsychotic drugs can cause significant Adverse effects are particularly some related to cognitive and extrapyramidal disturbances (eg, dystonia, tremor, tardive dyskinesia). Approximately 30% of patients with schizophrenia do not respond to typical antipsychotics. They may respond to clozapine, a second-generation antipsychotic. Table Typical Antipsychotics Clinical Calculator: QT Interval Correction (Electrocardiogram)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5.0,antipsychotics second generation antipsychotics,antipsychot second gener antipsychot,"Approximately 95% of prescribed antipsychotics are second generation antipsychotics. Second-generation antipsychotics block dopamine receptors more selectively than typical antipsychotics, reducing the likelihood of extrapyramidal (motor) side effects. Better binding to the serotonergic receptor may contribute to the antipsychotic activities on positive symptoms and the side effect benefits of SGA. Second-generation antipsychotics also work as follows: Tends to reduce positive symptoms May reduce negative symptoms more than typical antipsychotics (despite differences). This is controversial) May cause less cognitive impairment Less likely to have extrapyramidal side effects (including a much lower risk of tardive dyskinesia) Slight or no prolactin elevation (except risperidone , increases prolactin just like typical antipsychotics) May produce a metabolic syndrome, with insulin resistance, weight gain, and hypertension. Second-generation antipsychotics may reduce negative symptoms because they cause more parkinsonian side effects than typical antipsychotics. Clozapine, the first second-generation antipsychotic, is the only drug shown to be effective in up to 50% of patients in patients resistant to typical antipsychotics. Clozapine reduces negative symptoms, reduces suicide with little or no motor adverse effects, and has minimal risk of tardive dyskinesia but has other undesirable effects, including including drowsiness, hypotension, tachycardia, weight gain, type 2 diabetes, and increased salivation. This drug may also cause seizures in a dose-dependent manner. The most serious adverse effect is agranulocytosis, which may occur in about 1% of patients. Therefore, regular leukocyte monitoring (done weekly for the first 6 months and every 2 weeks thereafter, then once a month for one year) is needed in the United States, and clozapine is commonly used for The patient has had an inadequate response to other drugs. Newer SGAs (see table Second-generation antipsychotics) offer some of the benefits of clozapine without the risk of agranulocytosis and are generally better than typical antipsychotics in treating an acute phase and prevention of recurrence. However, in a large, long-term controlled clinical trial, the magnitude of symptom relief with any of the 4 second-generation antipsychotics (olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, ziprasidone) was not greater. perphenazine, a typical antipsychotic with anticholinergic effects. In a longitudinal follow-up study, patients leaving early were randomized to one of three studies with other second-generation antipsychotics or with clozapine; This study demonstrated a clear advantage of clozapine over other second-generation antipsychotics. Therefore, clozapine appears to be the only effective treatment for patients who have failed conventional antipsychotic treatment or second-generation antipsychotics. However, clozapine is still underutilized, possibly due to low tolerability and the need for continuous blood monitoring. Lumateperone is the newest SGA for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults. It has been shown to improve psychosocial functioning with few metabolic and motor side effects. It should not be used in older patients with dementia-related psychosis, in which it has a high risk of death. Other side effects include sedation and dry mouth. Table of Second Generation Antipsychotics* Newer second generation antipsychotics are very similar in efficacy but different in adverse events, so drug selection is based on individual response and other drug properties. For example, olanzapine, which has a relatively high rate of sedation, may be prescribed to patients whose symptoms of agitation or insomnia are prominent; Less sedating agents should probably be given to comatose patients. A trial of the drug for 4-8 weeks is necessary to assess effectiveness. After the acute symptoms have stabilized, maintenance therapy is initiated; For maintenance therapy, the lowest dose to prevent recurrence of symptoms is used. Aripiprazole, olanzapine, and risperidone are available as long-acting injections. Weight gain, hyperlipidemia, and increased risk of type 2 diabetes are the major adverse effects of second-generation antipsychotics. Therefore, prior to treatment with these agents, all patients should be screened for risk factors, including personal and family history of diabetes, weight, waist circumference, blood pressure , and fasting glucose and lipids. People with or at high risk of metabolic syndrome may be better treated with ziprasidone or aripiprazole than with other second-generation antipsychotics. Patients and families should be educated about the symptoms and signs of diabetes, including polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, and diabetic ketoacidosis (nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite). water, rapid breathing, cloudy consciousness). In addition, nutrition and physical activity counseling should be provided to all patients when they are initiating second-generation antipsychotics. All patients receiving second-generation antipsychotics require periodic monitoring of weight, body mass index, and fasting plasma glucose and indication for specialist evaluation if they develop hyperlipidemia. or type 2 diabetes. Sometimes, combining an antipsychotic with another medication is beneficial (1). These drugs include Antidepressants: Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors Another antipsychotic Lithium Benzodiazepine New dopamine receptor antagonists are being developed, including ABT- 925, BL1020, ITI 007, JNJ-37822681 and other new drugs (2).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment Acute neuroleptic side effects Tardive dyskinesia is often characterized by symptoms of puckering of the lips and tongue, finger movements, twisting of the arms, legs, or more. For patients on typical antipsychotics, the incidence of tardive dyskinesia is approximately 5% per year of medication and the incidence is significantly lower with SGA. In about 2%, tardive dyskinesia causes a severe change in appearance. In some patients, tardive dyskinesia persists indefinitely, even after the drug is stopped. Because of this risk, patients on long-term maintenance therapy should be evaluated at least every 6 months. Evaluation tools, such as the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale, should be used to more accurately track changes over time. Patients with schizophrenia who continue to require antipsychotics may be treated with second-generation antipsychotics, clozapine or quetiapine. Valbenazine, an inhibitor of vesicular transport monoamine-2, was recently approved for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia. The starting dose is 40 mg once daily and, in the absence of liver dysfunction, after 1 week is increased to 80 mg once daily. The most important adverse events were hypersensitivity, somnolence, QT prolongation, and parkinsonism.

With such people, distrust and suspicion towards others and their motives begins in early adulthood and lasts throughout life. Early symptoms may include feelings of being taken advantage of, preoccupation with the loyalty or reliability of friends, a tendency to read threatening connotations in peaceful remarks or events, constant enmity, and a willingness to respond to perceived slights. Some of the subcategories of delusional disorder are recognized: Delusion of being loved: Patients believe that another person is in love with them. Attempts to contact the subject of delusions through phone calls, letters, surveillance, or stalking are common. People who fall under this category may have conflicts with the law regarding this behavior. Delusions of pride: Patients believe they have a great talent or have made an important discovery. Jealousy delusions: Patients believe their partner or lover is unfaithful. This belief is based on incorrect inferences supported by unequivocal evidence. They may resort to physical assault. Persecutory delusions: Patients believe they are being plotted against, spied on, defamed, or harassed. They may continually seek justice through petitions to the courts and other government agencies and may use violence to retaliate for imaginary persecution. Somatic delusions: Delusions related to a bodily function; for example, patients believe they have a deformity, odor, or parasitic infection.

Neurodevelopmental Vulnerability Although schizophrenia rarely manifests itself in childhood, childhood factors influence the onset of the disease in adulthood. These factors include genetic predisposition Pre-, intra-, and postnatal complications Viral infections of the central nervous system Trauma and child abandonment Although many people with schizophrenia do not have a family history , but genetic factors are strongly involved. People with a first-degree relative with someone with schizophrenia have about a 10% to 12% risk of developing the disorder, compared with a 1% risk in the general population. Identical twins are about 45% identical. Maternal undernutrition and influenza infection in the second trimester of pregnancy, birth weight < 2500 g, Rh incompatibility in the second pregnancy, and hypoxia increase the risk. High-sensitivity neurobiology and neuropsychology suggest that abnormal chasing, cognitive and attention deficits, and impaired sensory reception are more common in these patients. schizophrenic population than the general population. These findings may also occur in first-degree relatives of individuals with schizophrenia, and indeed in patients with multiple other psychiatric disorders, and may represent a genetic part of vulnerability. The prevalence of these findings across psychotic disorders suggests that our usual diagnostic categories do not reflect fundamental biological differences between mental disorders (1). Environmental stressors Environmental stressors can trigger the onset or recurrence of psychotic symptoms in vulnerable individuals. Stress factors can be primarily biochemical (eg, substance abuse, especially marijuana) or social (eg, unemployment or poverty, leaving home for college, dissolution rupture of a romantic relationship, joining the Armed Forces); However, these stressors are not the cause. There is new evidence that environmental events can initiate gene changes that can influence gene duplication and disease onset. Protective factors that may minimize the impact of stress on symptom development or worsening include strong psychosocial support, well-developed coping skills, and antipsychotic medications.

5.0,schizophrenia prognosis of schizophrenia,schizophrenia prognosi schizophrenia,"Schizophrenia is a chronic illness that can progress through several stages, although the timing and patterns of the episodes can vary. Patients with schizophrenia tend to develop psychotic symptoms on average 8 to 15 months before receiving medical care. The symptoms of schizophrenia often impair functioning and often interfere with work, social relationships, and self-care. Unemployment, isolation, deteriorating relationships, and impaired quality of life are common consequences. Episodes of schizophrenia During the latent phase, the patient may be asymptomatic or may experience impaired social functioning, mild cognitive disturbances, or perceptual distortions, or reduced mental capacity. experience pleasure (insensitivity) and other general response deficits. These features may be mild and only recognised retrospectively or may be more noticeable, with impairments in social, educational, and occupational functioning. During the prodromal phase, subclinical symptoms may appear; they include withdrawal or isolation, irritability, suspicion, abnormal thinking, perceptual distortions, and disorganization (1). The onset of schizophrenia (delusions and hallucinations) can be sudden (over days or weeks) or slow and insidious (over many years). However, even during advanced delusional episodes, only a small fraction (< 40%) tend to develop complete schizophrenia. During the psychotic episode, the symptoms are active and often at their worst. In the intermediate phase, symptomatic episodes may occur episodic (with recognizable increase and remission) or continuous; functional deficits tend to worsen. In the late stages of the disease, the disease pattern can be established, but there is considerable variation; Disability can stabilize, worsen, or even lessen. Types of symptoms in schizophrenia In general, symptoms are classified as positive: Hallucinations and delusions Negative: Decrease or loss of normal and emotional functions Disorganization: Thought disorders and bizarre behavior Cognitive: Memory deficits in information processing and problem solving Patients can have symptoms ranging from one to all. Positive symptoms may be further classified as Delusions Hallucinations Delusions are false beliefs that are maintained despite clear conflicting evidence. There are several types of delusions: Persecutory delusions: Patients believe they are being tortured, followed, tricked, or spied on. Related delusions: Patients believe that passages from books, newspapers, song lyrics, or other environmental cues have a direct connection to them. Delusions about stolen or forced thinking: Patients believe that other people can read their minds, that their thoughts are contagious, or that their thoughts and impulses imposed on them by external forces The delusions in schizophrenia tend to be bizarre - i.e. not really rational and not derived from normal life experiences (e.g. belief that someone removed their organs without scarring). Hallucinations are perceptual sensations that no one else can perceive. They can be auditory, visual, olfactory, tactile, or tactile, but auditory hallucinations are the most common. Patients may hear voices commenting on their behavior, conversing with each other, or making critical and insulting comments. Delusions and hallucinations can be extremely distressing for the patient. Negative (deficiency) symptoms include Blurred Emotions: Patient's face is motionless, with poor eye contact and lack of expression. Poor language: Patient is quiet and responds briefly to questions, creating the impression of inner emptiness Loss of pleasure: There is a lack of interest in activities and an increase in aimless activities destination. Unsocial: There is a lack of interest in relationships. Negative symptoms often lead to poor motivation and a reduced sense of purpose and purpose. Disorganized symptoms, which can be considered a positive symptom category, are related Thinking disorders Strange behavior Thinking is disorganized, with disjointed, non-targeted expression directly from one topic to another. Language can range from mildly disorganized to incoherent and incomprehensible. Outrageous behavior may include childish innocence, agitation, and appearance, personal hygiene, or inappropriate behavior. Tonic tension is an extremely typical example of bizarre behavior, which can include maintaining a rigid posture and resisting attempts to change posture or perform involuntary motor activities, and is not recommended. Cognitive deficits include impairments in the following aspects: Attention ability Processing speed Working and declarative memory Abstract thinking Problem solving Understanding of social interactions Thinking of Patients may be inflexible, and their ability to solve problems, understand other people's perspectives, and learn from experience may be impaired. The severity of cognitive impairment is a major determinant of general dysfunction. Schizophrenia Subtypes Some experts classify schizophrenia into deficiency and nondeficiency subtypes depending on the presence and severity of negative symptoms, such as emotional blunting , lack of motivation, and impaired judgment of purpose. Patients with the deficiency subgroup had prominent negative symptoms that were not attributable to other factors (eg, depression, anxiety, less stimulating environment, adverse drug effects). Patients with the non-deficiency subtype may have delusions, hallucinations, and thought disturbances but almost no negative symptoms. Previously recognized subtypes of schizophrenia (paranoid, disorganized, catatonic, sequelae, undifferentiated) have not demonstrated validity or reliability and are no longer used use anymore. Suicide About 5 to 6% of patients with schizophrenia attempt suicide, and about 20% attempt suicide; A greater number had significant suicidal ideation. Suicide is a major cause of premature death in people with schizophrenia and explains, in part, why the disorder reduces life expectancy by 10 years on average. The risk may be especially high for young people with schizophrenia and a substance use disorder. The risk is also increased in patients with symptoms of depression or feeling hopeless, who are unemployed, or who have recently had a psychotic episode or have been discharged from the hospital. Patients with late onset and good potential function - those with the best prognosis for recovery - also have the highest risk of suicide. Because these patients retain the capacity for grief and pain, they may be prone to acting out of frustration based on realistic perceptions of the effects of their disorder. Violence Schizophrenia is a surprisingly modest risk factor for violent behavior. Threats of violence and outbursts of aggression are more common than seriously dangerous behavior. Indeed, people with schizophrenia are generally less violent than people without schizophrenia. Patients who are significantly more likely to be violent include those with substance use disorders, victimization delusions, or command hallucinations, and those who do not take prescription medications. A small number of people with depression, social isolation, and paranoid syndrome attack or kill someone they attribute to their hardship (e.g. an authority figure, a celebrity, their spouse) ).

A small number of people with depression, social isolation, and paranoid syndrome attack or kill someone they attribute to their hardship (e.g. an authority figure, a celebrity, their spouse) ).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During the first 5 years after the onset of symptoms, functioning may deteriorate and social and work skills may be impaired, with gradual neglect of self-care. Negative symptoms may increase to varying degrees, and cognitive function may be impaired. After that, the degree of dysfunction tends to stabilize. Some evidence suggests that the severity of the disease may decrease with age, especially in women. Idiopathic movement disorders may develop in patients with severe negative symptoms and cognitive dysfunction, even when antipsychotics are not used. Schizophrenia can occur along with other mental disorders. When combined with a significant degree of obsessive-compulsive symptoms, the prognosis is particularly poor; With borderline personality disorder symptoms, the prognosis is better. About 80% of people with schizophrenia experience one or more episodes of major depression at some point in their lives. During the first year after diagnosis, prognosis is closely related to adherence to psychotropic medications. Overall, one third of patients achieved significant and lasting improvement; a third improved somewhat but had persistent relapses and left dysfunction; and a third are still seriously incapacitated. Only about 15% of patients fully return to their pre-disease level of function. Factors associated with a good prognosis include Having good function before the onset of the disease (eg, good education, having good job ability before the onset of the disease) Late and/or sudden onset Family with money History of affective disorders other than schizophrenia Mild cognitive impairment Few negative symptoms Short duration of untreated psychosis Factors associated with poor prognosis include Young age of onset Prior function poor onset Family history of schizophrenia Many negative symptoms Longer duration of untreated psychosis Men have worse outcomes than women; Women respond better to antipsychotic treatment. Substance abuse is a significant problem for many patients with schizophrenia. There is some evidence that the use of marijuana and other hallucinogens is seriously disruptive in patients with schizophrenia and should be strongly discouraged. Substance use is a clear poor prognostic factor and can lead to withdrawal, repeated relapses, frequent re-hospitalization, functional impairment, and loss of social support, including homelessness. reside.

When treated early, patients tend to respond more quickly and adequately. Without antipsychotic maintenance therapy after the first episode, 70 to 80% of patients will have a second episode within 12 months. Continuous use of antipsychotics can reduce 1-year relapse rates to about 30% or less with long-acting agents. Continuous drug therapy is maintained for 1 to 2 years after the first phase. If the patient has been ill for longer, the medication is maintained for many years. Early detection and multifaceted treatment have transformed the care of patients with mental disorders such as schizophrenia. Coordinating intensive care, including resilience training, individual and family therapy, cognitive disorder resolution, and assisted employment, is an important contributor to mental rehab. social science. The overall goal for the treatment of schizophrenia is to reduce the severity of psychotic symptoms Preserve psychosocial functioning Prevent recurrence of episodes of symptoms and functional impairment Reduce recreational drug use Antipsychotics, rehabilitation with community support services, and psychotherapy are key components of treatment. Because schizophrenia is a chronic and relapsing disease, teaching patients self-management skills is an important overall goal. Providing information about the disorder (psychoeducation) to parents can reduce relapse rates (1, 2). (See also American Psychiatric Association's Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia, 3rd ed.) Antipsychotics are divided into first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs) and first-generation antipsychotics. The second (SGA) is based on affinity and activity for their specific neurotransmitter receptors. Second-generation antipsychotic agents may offer some advantages both in terms of slightly better efficacy (although recent evidence is skeptical of their superiority if taken together in 1 group) and reduced the likelihood of spontaneous dyskinesia and related adverse events. However, the risk of metabolic syndrome (excessive abdominal fat, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension) is greater with second-generation antipsychotics than with typical antipsychotics. Some antipsychotics in both classes can cause long QT syndrome and eventually increase the risk of fatal arrhythmias; These drugs include thioridazine, haloperidol, olanzapine, risperidone, and ziprasidone. Rehabilitation and community support services Psychosocial skills training programs and occupational rehabilitation programs help many patients work, shop, and care for themselves; manage a family; get along with others; and working with mental health workers. Assisted employment, in which the patient is placed in a competitive work environment and supported by an on-site job tutor to promote job adaptation, can be of particular value. During this time, job mentors are only used as a backup to solve problems or to communicate with employers. Support services allow many people with schizophrenia to live in the community. While most can live independently, some require a supervised apartment where staff are staffed to ensure medication compliance. Programs that provide supervision in different neighborhoods range from 24-hour support to periodic home visits. These programs help promote patient autonomy when adequate care is provided to minimize the likelihood of recurrence and the need for inpatient hospitalization. Intensive community treatment programs that provide services in the patient's home or other residence and are based on a high staff-patient ratio; treatment groups provide all or nearly all required treatment services directly. Hospitalization or rotational in-hospital treatment may be necessary for severe relapses, and mandatory hospitalization may be necessary if the patient poses a danger to self or others. Even with the best rehabilitation and community support services, a small percentage of patients, especially those with severe cognitive deficits and those who are poorly responsive to drug therapy, require seek supportive care or long-term hospital stay. Cognitive therapy is beneficial for some patients. This therapy is designed to improve neurocognitive function (eg, attention, short-term memory, executive function) and to help patients learn or relearn how to perform tasks.

In addition to individual psychotherapy, there has been significant development in cognitive behavioral therapy for schizophrenia. For example, this therapy, done in an individual or group therapy setting, may focus on ways to reduce paranoid thoughts.

Gender identity is the subjective sense of knowing what gender an individual belongs to; ie, people consider themselves male, female, transgender, or another term (e.g., genderqueer, non-binary, gender-neutral). Gender role is the objective, public expression of gender identity and includes everything people say and do to indicate to themselves and to others the degree to which they are the gender they identify with. determined. Gender role behavior falls within the traditional masculine and feminine continuum, with a widespread cultural recognition that some people are not attuned – nor necessarily attuned – to the male dichotomy. and traditionally female. These people may refer to themselves as genderqueer, nonbinary, or one of many other terms that have become more common in the past 10 years. Furthermore, definitions and classifications of gender roles can vary between societies.

Some members of the transgender community view extreme forms of gender mismatch as simply a normal variation in people's gender identity and expression. However, when awareness of a mismatch between birth sex and gender identity causes someone to experience significant distress or disability, a diagnosis of gender dysphoria may be appropriate — focusing on the pain the person's suffering rather than the presence of gender inequality. Suffering is often a combination of anxiety, depression, and emotional instability. People with severe gender dysphoria, formerly known as transgender people, can experience severe, uncomfortable, and persistent symptoms and often have a desire to change their medical and/or body shape. or surgery to make their bodies more consistent with their gender identity.

Gender inappropriate behavior, such as wearing the clothes of the opposite sex, may not require treatment if it occurs without psychological stress or impairment. Such behavior is not considered a disorder. When treatment is needed, the goal of treatment is to ease the patient's suffering and help them adapt rather than to try to discourage them from their identity. Attempts to change adult gender identity have not proven effective and are now considered unethical. In most Western cultures, most patients with gender dysphoria who require treatment are male from birth, who assert their gender identity as female and consider their genitals and other features to be female. their masculinity with disgust. However, as treatments improve, female-to-male (transgender) transgender people are increasingly seen in medical and psychiatric practice, despite the prevalence of the disease in different backgrounds. Western culture is about a third of the male-to-female transgender ratio. The primary goal in seeking medical help for most people with gender dysphoria is not to receive psychological treatment but to obtain hormones and/or gender confirmation surgery ( transgender or genital) to approximate their perceived gender identity. A combination of psychotherapy, sex-affirming hormone therapy, living at least one year of sex, and sex-confirmation surgery can be curable when the disorder is appropriately diagnosed and the clinician willing to follow internationally accepted standards of care for the treatment of disordered gender identity, available from the World Association of Transgender Health Professionals (WPATH), Although patients with gender dysphoria do not Psychotherapy is still required before considering sex-affirming hormone therapy and surgical procedures, but mental health practitioners can do the following things to help patients make informed decisions: Making informed decisions: Assessment and treatment of co-occurring disorders (eg, depression, substance use disorders) Help patients deal with the negative effects of stigma (eg, disapproval , discriminatory) Help the patient find a comfortable gender expression If possible, facilitate gender role change, emergence, and transition Gender depression at birth male gender For male patients female (trans-female), moderate-dose feminizing hormone (eg, estradiol 0.1 to 0.15 mg/day transdermal patch) plus electrolysis, voice therapy, and other methods Other feminization treatments may make female gender role correction more feasible and stable. Female sex hormones have significant beneficial effects on psychotic symptoms, often before any change in secondary sex characteristics (eg, breast maturation, reduction in sex drive) growth of beard and body hair, redistribution of fat to the hips). Feminizing hormones, even without psychological or surgical support, are all some patients need to make them feel as comfortable as women. Many transgender women require gender confirmation surgery. Although there are several approaches, the most common surgeries include removal of the penis, testicles, and artificial vagina. Part of the glans penis is retained as a clitoris, which is usually sexually sensitive and maintains the ability to orgasm in most cases. The decision to pursue gender confirmation surgery often raises significant social issues for the patient. Many of these patients are married and have children. Transgender parents or spouses may have significant adjustment problems in their romantic relationships and may lose loved ones in the process. In follow-up studies, genital surgery has helped many people with gender dysphoria lead happier and more productive lives. Therefore, this surgery is considered medically necessary for highly motivated, appropriately evaluated and treated patients for gender dysphoria who have completed at least 1 year of full survival. time with heterosexual roles. Some patients also pursue non-surgical, gender-affirming surgeries such as breast augmentation, facial contouring (eg, rhinoplasty, leg lift, jaw reshaping, tracheostomy). ) or vocal cord surgery changes the quality of the voice. Participation in gender support groups, available in most major cities or through the internet, is often helpful.

Hysterectomy and oophorectomy can then be performed after a course of androgen hormone therapy (eg, testosterone ester preparations 300 to 400 mg IM every 3 weeks or equivalent doses of patches skin patch or androgen gel). Testosterone preparations often sustainably deepen the voice, increase muscle mass in men and redistribute fat, cause clitoris hypertrophy, and promote body hair and facial hair growth. The patient can choose from one of the following options: A prosthetic (neophallus) made from skin implants from the forearm, leg, or abdomen (penile reconstruction) A small penis made up of organs fatty tissue is removed from the instep and placed around the clitoris hypertrophy due to testosterone (small penis reconstruction) With either procedure, a scrotal reconstruction is usually also performed; The labia majora is cut to form pore structures that closely resemble the scrotum, and testicular implants are performed to fill the scrotum. Surgery can help certain patients achieve greater adaptation and satisfaction. Similar to transgender women, transgender men must live in the male gender role for at least 1 year before being referred for irreversible genital surgery. The anatomical outcomes of penile plasty procedures are often less functionally and visually satisfactory than transvaginal female procedures, which may result in relatively few definitive surgical requirements. receive gender from transgender men. As penile shaping techniques continue to improve, the requirements for phalloplasty have increased. Surgical complications are common, especially in procedures involving enlargement of the urethra to a penile reconstruction. These complications can include urinary tract infections, fistulas, urethral strictures, and urinary deviation. Gender depression in children The treatment of prepubertal children diagnosed with gender dysphoria is controversial. The majority of children regardless of gender in childhood do not continue into adolescence or adulthood with a transgender identity. At this time, it is not possible to predict with certainty which children with gender dysphoria will persist with such symptoms into adulthood. Although there is no clinical consensus on the treatment of children with prepubertal gender dysphoria, it has been recognized that attempts to force children to accept innately assigned gender roles are often damaging. hurt and failed. Therefore, the main modality of treatment is psychological support and psychological education for children and their parents, using a gender-affirmation model rather than a sex-pathological model. This affirmative approach supports the child in terms of gender expression, sometimes including prepubertal social transitions. Before puberty, there are currently no indications for medical or surgical intervention for dyssexual children (1). Among adolescents, substances that prevent puberty are more commonly used today. Drugs such as leuprolide (gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist) block the production of testosterone and estrogen, thereby ""stopping"" the progression of puberty. These medications may be used at Developmental Stage II Tanner, allowing more time to evaluate adolescents with gender dysphoria (2), see Endocrine Society Guidelines, 2017. If youth have gender dysphoria, see Endocrine Society Guidelines, 2017. If gender dysphoria wants to continue with the full transition, puberty-blocking substances will be discontinued and sex-affirming hormones (formerly known as cross-sex hormones) used, enabling the onset of puberty in the experienced sex.

Early recognition of the disorder and early request for psychiatric or psychological consultation is important, to avoid dangerous invasive trials, surgical procedures, and the use of excessive or unwarranted medications. A non-aggressive, non-punishment, non-confrontational approach should be used to present a diagnosis of pseudodisease disorder to the patient. To avoid suggesting guilt or shame, the doctor may offer the diagnosis as an aid.

1.0,suicidal behavior epidemiology of suicidal behavior,suicid behavior epidemiolog suicid behavior,"Statistics on suicide are largely based on death certificates, investigative reports, and underestimate actual rates. To provide more reliable information in the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has established a state-based system that collects data on individual incidents of violence from a variety of sources to provides a clearer understanding of the causes of violent deaths (homicide and suicide), the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS). NVDRS is currently in place in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. In the United States, suicide is the 10th leading cause of death. The age group with the highest suicide rates today are people aged 45 to 64, a result of the recent dramatic increase in the population. Why this rate has increased is still unknown; However, the following factors may have contributed: Years earlier, as teenagers, this group had higher rates of depression than older groups, and the researchers predicted Their suicide rate will increase as they get older. This rate includes the increased number of suicides among service members and veterans (20% of suicides fall within that group). This prevalence may also derive from intertwined influences, including the unmet expectations and beliefs of this particular cohort, the proliferation of lethal means, the opioid crisis , changes in the economy, and persistent stigma associated with addressing mental health conditions. The second highest suicide rate among people ≥ 75 years old. In the 1990s, teen suicide rates fell after more than a decade of steady increases, only to begin to rise again with an alarming rise in gun suicide rates. In all age groups, the number of deaths in men was 3.5 to 1 higher than the number of deaths in women. The reason is unclear, but possible explanations include Men seeming are less likely to seek help when they are suffering. Men have higher rates of alcohol abuse and substance use disorders, leading to suicidal tendencies. Men are more aggressive and use more lethal methods when attempting suicide. The number of suicides among men includes suicides by military personnel and veterans, where there is a higher proportion of males than females. White men account for 7 out of every 10 suicides in the United States even though they make up about a third of the population. In 2019, an estimated 1.4 million American adults had suicidal thoughts. Approximately 25 attempts are made for each death that occurs by suicide. Many people have committed suicide many times. Only 5 to 10% of people who make one suicide attempt end in death; However, in the elderly, 1 in 4 suicide attempts end in death. Although men die from suicide more than women, women attempt suicide 2 to 3 times more often than men; Among young adults and young adults, there may be 100 trials for girls and 1 trial for boys of the same age. A suicide note is left about 1 in 6 people who commit suicide complete. Content may provide clues to factors that lead to suicide (eg, mental illness, hopelessness, cognitive limitations and narrowing of cognitive options for coping, feelings of becoming burden on others and feelings of isolation). The intersection of these and other stressors or loss in life can lead to suicide. Contagious suicide refers to a phenomenon in which a person who commits suicide is likely to reach others in the community, school, or workplace. Well-publicized suicides can have very widespread effects. Those affected are often already vulnerable people. Humans are social creatures that tend to imitate each other. Teenagers tend to imitate more than adults because they are at a stage of psychological development and brain development. It is estimated that transmission is a factor in 1 to 5% of teen suicides. Contagion can occur through exposure to a peer who has attempted or died by suicide, by widespread media coverage of a celebrity's suicide, or by photographs and/or photos and/or videos. or sensational depictions of suicide in the mass media. Conversely, media coverage with a positive message about a suicide death can reduce the risk and/or impact of suicide contagion for vulnerable adolescents. . Positive messaging often includes portraying mental health struggles as part of people's lives and health experiences without the stigma associated with helping with finding and treatment. . After a suicide occurs, positive messages in schools or workplaces clearly communicate the tragic loss of a community member and continue to express support for the community. grieve and provide resources for support. In writing or in face-to-face meetings to share the loss, the language the leader uses to talk about suicide is critical. For more detailed information on communication and written communication patterns, please see the Post-Suicide Toolkit freely available on the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention website (afsp.org). . Suicide transmission can also spread in schools and workplaces that - in some ways - are ideal settings to implement and follow post-intervention principles to prevent future suicides. . Other types of suicide are extremely rare.

1.0,etiology of suicidal behavior,etiolog suicid behavior,"The current scientific view of suicide holds that, although complex, suicide is a health-related event that involves a range of genetic, environmental, and psychological/behavioral factors. Psychographic studies clearly show that in every suicide case, the deceased experienced multiple risk factors for suicide. Research has shown that 85 to 95% of people who die by suicide have a diagnosable mental health condition at the time of their death. One of the most common, powerful, and fixable risk factors for suicide is depression. Duration of a depressive episode was the strongest predictor of suicide. For patients with depression, the risk of suicide may be increased during periods of more severe depression and when several other risk factors converge. In addition, suicide appears to be more common when severe anxiety is part of major depression or bipolar depression. The risk of suicidal thoughts and attempts may increase in younger age groups after starting antidepressants (see Treatment of depression and suicide risk and Risk of suicide and antidepressants). . Effective treatment of depression with medication and/or some form of psychotherapy is considered an effective way to reduce the overall risk of suicide. Other risk factors for suicide include: Most other serious mental health conditions Previous suicide attempts Personality disorders (eg, borderline personality disorder) Impulsivity and aggression Aggressive childhood traumatic experiences Family history of suicide and/or psychiatric conditions Alcohol use, drug abuse, and prescription pain medication Serious or chronic physical health condition ( eg, chronic pain, traumatic brain injury) Time loss (eg, death of family or friends) Relationship conflict (eg, divorce) Work interruption (eg, unemployment) ) Periods of career transition (eg, changing military status from active duty to veteran status or retirement) Financial stress (eg, recession, underemployment) Bullying (eg, cyberbullying, social rejection, discrimination, humiliation) (See table Risk factors and warning signs for suicide.) Death by suicide is more common. among people with mental illness when compared with controls of the same age and sex. (See Table of Frequency of Mental Health Disorders in Suicide.) Table of Frequency of Mental Health Disorders with Suicide* People with schizophrenia die by suicide at a much higher rate than the general population. Overall, up to 10% of schizophrenic patients die by suicide. Risk factors for suicide in people with schizophrenia include early illness, depressive episodes, hallucinations, failure to access or follow effective treatment, disability, hopelessness and restlessness. Other well-known psychosocial risk factors for suicide include relationship disruption, unemployment, and loss. Alcohol and substance abuse can increase depression and impulsivity as well as make emotions worse - a potentially fatal combination. About 30% to 40% of people who die by suicide were drinking before attempting suicide, and about half of them were intoxicated at the time. Impulsive young men and women are especially susceptible to the effects of alcohol; where moderate intoxication can lead to the use of more lethal suicide methods (1). However, people with alcohol use disorders are at increased risk of suicide even when they are not intoxicated. Serious physical health conditions, especially chronic illnesses and pain, contribute to about 20% of suicides among the elderly. Newly diagnosed or new-onset physical health conditions may also increase the risk of suicide (eg, diabetes, seizure disorders, pain conditions, multiple sclerosis, cancer, infections) infection, HIV/AIDS). These health conditions can directly affect the physiological functioning of the brain and, therefore, increase the risk of suicide. The psychological effects of disability, pain, or a new diagnosis of a serious health condition can also increase suicide risk. People with personality disorders are prone to suicide, especially those with borderline or antisocial personality disorder, who may have problems with stress intolerance and reaction patterns between individuals, including self-injurious and aggressive behavior. Stressful childhood experiences, especially those of sexual or physical abuse or separation from parents, have been linked to suicide attempts and perhaps suicide completion. Genetics of suicide risk is an important area of research and appears to influence suicide risk. Although suicide risk can run in families, genes seem to account for only a fraction of that risk (2). A family history of suicide, suicide attempt, or mental disorder is associated with an increased risk of suicide. Both genes and environment are important when it comes to suicide risk. It has been suggested that epigenetic changes (eg, DNA methylation) affecting gene expression may increase or decrease suicide risk by influencing neurophysiology, cognition, or regulation. tension adjustment. This means that negative experiences such as trauma and conversely positive experiences such as the social support of psychotherapy can actually alter gene expression and significantly affect the ability to recovery and an individual's risk of suicide. This is an area of research that is trying to determine the role of epigenetics. Psychological traits such as impulsive tendencies, perceived rigidity, interpersonal rejection sensitivity, or severe neuroticism may also increase risk. Etiology References 1.

(The combination of these factors certainly influences the prevalence of pesticide poisoning as a common means of suicide in most Asian countries.) Some modalities (eg, jumping from altitude) makes survival virtually impossible, while other methods (eg, taking medication) can save lives. However, the use of a method that has been shown to be non-fatal does not necessarily imply that the suicidal intent is less severe. For suicide attempts, medication is the most common modality used. Violent methods, such as shooting and hanging, are uncommon among suicide attempts. About 50% of successful suicides in the United States are by firearm; Men use this method more than women.

These standards include recommendations for screening, suicide risk assessment, and clinical care in primary care, behavioral health, and emergency departments (1). It is important to note that suicide risk is dynamic. The acute risk usually lasts only for a short period of time (a few hours to a few days). In the majority of suicides, patients were seen in various health care settings during the acute at-risk period, but the risk of suicide was not detected. Any sound public health strategy to reduce suicide will equip clinicians in all health care settings (even those outside behavioral health) to take the initiative. seek and reduce any and all risks associated with suicide. This can be done by having health care professionals use a concern response Provide concise interventions (eg, safety planning and means of death advice) people) Communicating with the patient's family and close friends Refer the patient to appropriate care Currently, these steps have the strongest evidence for reducing suicide risk and saving lives. Certain periods are known to be associated with a high risk of suicide. The period of days to weeks after discharge from the emergency department or psychiatric hospital for patients admitted with suicidal ideation or attempted suicide is only such a period and, therefore, is main point of the intervention (2). A healthcare practitioner predicting impending suicide in a patient is, in most jurisdictions, required to notify the appropriate authority for intervention. Failure to do so may result in criminal and civil action. At-risk patients should not be left alone until they are in a safe environment (usually a psychiatric facility). If necessary, such patients should be transported to a safe environment by trained professionals (eg, emergency medical technicians, police). Current advocacy efforts in the United States, United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia, and elsewhere aim to reform the crisis response system toward reliance on a pool of health resources. stronger multi-layered mental health as mobile and comprehensive crisis units care and away from their current reliance on emergency rooms and law enforcement. Any act of suicide, whether gesture or attempted, must be taken seriously. People with serious injuries must be evaluated and treated for physical injuries. If an overdose of a potentially lethal drug is confirmed, immediate steps are taken to administer an antidote and provide supportive treatment (see Poisoning). The initial assessment may be performed by any health care practitioner trained in the assessment and management of suicidal behavior. However, all patients should receive a thorough suicide risk assessment — usually by a psychiatrist, psychologist, or other trained mental health professional — as soon as possible. . A decision must be made as to whether the patient should be voluntarily admitted or not committed to treatment, and whether restraint is necessary (see also Behavioral emergencies). Patients with psychosis and several major depressive disorders and an unresolved crisis should be admitted to a psychiatric unit. Patients with symptoms of an underlying medical disorder (eg, delirium, seizures, fever) may need to be admitted to a medical unit with appropriate suicide precautions. After a suicide attempt, the patient may deny any problem because severe depression that leads to the act of suicide can be followed by short-term emotional upheaval. However, the risk of subsequent total suicide is high unless the patient receives ongoing treatment and psychosocial support. A suicide risk assessment identifies key drivers that contribute to an individual's current risk of suicide and helps the clinician to plan appropriate treatment. Evaluation includes the following: Establishing rapport and listening to patient reports Understand suicide attempt, context of action, prior events, and circumstances Ask about mental health symptoms and any alternative medications or treatments the patient may be using to treat their mental health condition or relieve symptoms Fully assess their condition mental health of the patient, with particular emphasis on identifying depression, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, severe insomnia, other mental disorders, and alcohol or drug use disorders (many issues) need special treatment other than crisis intervention) Gain insight into personal and family relationships, which are often consistent with suicide attempts Interview close family members and friends Ask about the presence of firearms or other lethal means in the home and advice on lethal means (this may involve facilitating safe storage or disposal of lethal means out of the home) Mental health management Create a safety plan to help the patient identify causes of a suicide plan develop plans to deal with suicidal thoughts as they happen (3, 4). Other steps that clinicians should take include providing patients with crisis resources, counseling on how to remove or store lethal means (5, 6), and refer for referrals for treatment. appropriate risk-reducing care (eg, cognitive-behavioral therapy, dialectical behavior therapy, cooperative assessment and suicide management [CAMS], family therapy; 4, 7 -ten). Clinicians may also provide patients with more frequent communication through outpatient visits or different forms of communication, some of which may be led by other members of the care team. health care provided (11).

1.0,suicidal behavior management of suicidal behavior,suicid behavior manag suicid behavior,"Suicide prevention requires identification of those at high risk (see table Risk factors and warning signs of suicide) and initiation of appropriate interventions. A public health model can be used to extend suicide prevention strategies. Implementing key strategies across the population (whole population) can reduce suicide rates. Therefore, suicide prevention efforts are critically important at the regional and national level. These efforts are complemented by health care that is effective in reducing the risk of suicide. Community-level interventions have also shown promising results in reducing suicide risk. There are school health and public health interventions. An example is the Sources of Strength suicide prevention program, run by teenage peer leaders in high schools (1). Studies have also shown that proper training of suicide support volunteers helps callers and can therefore save lives (2). Another powerful example of the effectiveness of a selective and universal suicide prevention program is demonstrated by the results regarding Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act (GLS) grants. These grants have funded youth suicide prevention activities in the United States since 2004, on college campuses as well as in community and tribal settings in many states. Over a 15-year period, a large percentage of counties in the United States received financial funding to participate in youth suicide prevention initiatives, including the following (3): establish outreach, awareness, and screening programs Provide “gatekeeper” training (i.e., educate people in key frontline roles to recognize suicide risk and intervene accordingly ) Develop coalitions (usually consisting of several local groups, such as local government agencies for mental health or suicide prevention, nonprofit organizations focused on suicide prevention) , educators, parent groups, faith-based groups, law enforcement, etc.) Implement policies and/or procedures Establish and fund a Forty percent grant hotline GLS is awarded in rural areas of the United States, where suicide rates are higher and where resources for clinical programs and treatment tend to be much less than in other areas. In one study, counties with GLS activity were compared with control counties not exposed to GLS programs. All counties were matched for demographic characteristics (race/ethnicity, median household income, youth and adult unemployment and suicide rates). Significant reductions were found in both short- and long-term effects on suicidal behaviors and suicide deaths. The positive effect is greatest in rural areas of the United States (3, 4). Another innovative national initiative in the United States led by the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (Project 2025) aims to reduce the suicide rate in the United States by 20% by 2025. In the clinical field, there are consensus that patients hospitalized after a suicide attempt have the highest risk of death from suicide within the first few days or weeks after discharge, and this risk remains high for the first 6 to 12 months . after discharge from hospital. After that, the risk of suicide fluctuates, but is always higher than for people who have never killed themselves. Therefore, before a patient is discharged from the hospital, they - along with family members and/or close friends - should be counseled about the immediate risk of death from suicide, and an appointment should be made. re-examination in the first week after discharge. A simple phone call or two after discharge has been shown to significantly reduce the occurrence of retries. In addition, the patient and family members or friends should be told the patient's name, dose, and frequency of medication use. During the first weeks after discharge, family and friends should make sure that the patient should not be left alone. Patient compliance with the prescribed dosing regimen must be monitored. Patients were asked daily about their general state of mind, mood, sleep habits, and energy (eg, waking, dressing, and interacting with others). The patient's family members or friends should refer the patient to follow-up appointments and should inform the healthcare practitioner of the patient's progress or non-progression. These interventions should be continued for several months after discharge. Table of Risk Factors and Warning Signs for Suicide Although some suicide attempts or completions are a surprise and shock, even for loved ones and associates, the warning signs can be may be obvious to family members, friends, or health care providers. The warning is often very obvious, as when a patient is actually discussing plans or suddenly writes or changes a will. However, the warnings can be more subtle, like when a patient makes an opinion that nothing is worth living or dying for. On average, primary care physicians encounter ≥6 potentially suicidal people in practice each year. Approximately 77% of suicide deaths were detected by a physician within the year prior to suicide, and approximately 32% were followed up by a physician monitoring mental status in the previous year. Because severe and painful physical disorders, substance use disorders, and mental disorders (especially depression) are often risk factors for suicide, recognize these risk factors and initiating appropriate treatment are important contributions that doctors can make to suicide prevention. Every depressed patient must be questioned about suicidal thoughts. The fear that such questioning might give rise to the idea of self-destruction in the patient is unfounded. Such questioning helps the physician get a clearer picture of the severity of the depression, encourages constructive discussion, and conveys the physician's perception of the patient's deep frustration and despair. core. Even patients with impending suicide threats (e.g. those who call and claim that they will take a potentially lethal dose of a drug or threaten to jump from a height) are considered desirable. to live. The doctor or other person they call for help must support this desire to live. Psychiatric emergency support for suicidal people includes the following: Establishing relationships and communicating openly with them Asking about current and past psychiatric care and medications currently being taken Help address the problem that is causing the crisis Provide constructive help with the problem, including a safety plan developed with the patient Start treatment for the underlying mental disorder Move them to a place appropriate follow-up care as soon as possible Discharge low-risk patients with a caring and understanding relative or friend Provide these patients with Lifeline phone numbers – 1- 800-273-TALK (8255) – or link to Lifeline Crisis Chat, Crisis Text Line (text HOME to 741741) or American Foundation for Suicide Prevention Provides access to information on suicide prevention References on prevention 1.

Treatment of depression and suicide risk The combination of antidepressants and some short-term psychotherapy has been shown to be ideal for treating depression. People with depression are at high risk for suicide and should be carefully monitored for suicidal behavior and ideas. The risk of suicide may soon increase during treatment for depression, while mental retardation and indecision have improved but feelings of depression are only partially elevated. When antidepressants are started or when the dose is increased, some patients experience increased agitation, anxiety, and depression, which can increase the likelihood of suicidal thoughts and even suicidal behavior. in some rare cases. Recent public health warnings about the association between antidepressant use and suicidal thoughts and attempts in children, adolescents, and young adults have significantly reduced (>30 %) prescribing antidepressants for these people. However, the youth suicide rate increased 14% during the same period. Thus, by discouraging drug treatment of depression, these warnings may have temporarily led to more, but not fewer, suicide deaths. These findings all suggest that the best approach is to encourage treatment, but with appropriate care such as Prescribing antidepressants at non-toxic doses Prioritizing antidepressants that are not lethal if overdosed More frequent visits and monitoring during treatment Give clear warnings to patient and family members and significant others to be on the lookout for symptoms such as agitation , insomnia, or suicidal thoughts Instruct patients, family members, and significant others to call their prescribing physician immediately or seek nearby care if symptoms worsen or have suicidal thoughts. Several studies have shown that lithium, when given with antidepressants and atypical neuroleptics, reduces the number of suicide deaths in patients with major depression or psychosis. bipolar. Lithium, even at low doses, is highly effective as an antidepressant for recurrent depressive disorder. In addition, clozapine reduces the risk of suicide in patients with schizophrenia. There are many new treatments being studied for patients with depression and suicide, including psychological and medical interventions with intramuscular esketamine and alcohol addiction treatment. Intranasal esketamine is currently approved for adults with difficult-to-treat depression and those with major depressive disorder and suicidal thoughts. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) remains effective for treating major depression and suicidal depression. ECT and transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) have been approved for the treatment of treatment-resistant depression and may be considered for patients with intractable depression, psychotic depression, or bipolar disorder. Both of these forms of treatment may also be helpful in reducing the risk of suicide (1, 2). Treatment References 1.

1.0,suicidal behavior effects of suicide,suicid behavior effect suicid,"Any act of suicide has a marked emotional effect on all involved. Loss to suicide is a particularly painful and complex type of loss. Suicide-related grief differs from other types of loss because of the unanswered questions surrounding why someone dies by suicide and because many people have limited knowledge about suicide. In an attempt to understand the inexplicable and shocking event (suicide), people often launch an intense information search and come up with a series of theories as to why the suicide happened. . This can lead to guilt, blame, and anger directed at yourself and others for not preventing suicide, and also anger at the deceased loved one. The natural part of this suicidal pain is usually extremely intense during the first few months and often lessens in intensity during the second year on. A large number of individuals are affected by each suicide death, including family members, friends, co-workers, and others. An international meta-analysis of population-based suicide disappearance studies found that 4.3% of community members had committed suicide by someone else in the past year and 21.8% during their lifetime. their. In the United States, exposure rates are even higher. From a national sample of 1432 adults, 51% had been exposed to suicidal behavior and 35% met the criteria for loss of suicide (defined as experiencing moderate to moderate emotional distress). loss-related suicide) at some point in their lives (1–3). Physicians can provide valuable support to patients who are suicidal. For clinicians to lose a patient to suicide, the experience can be far more traumatic than other clinically relevant deaths. It is often more similar to the traumatic and profoundly grieving experience of a physician's family member's death than it is to the loss of a patient. In one study, half of the psychiatrists who lost patients to suicide had an Event Scale Impact score comparable to that of a clinical population who had experienced the death of a parent (4). Loss experiences for medical professionals are often both personal and professional, which can include grief, guilt, lack of confidence, complex grief, and even thoughts. leave the profession. Resources are available to clinicians through a number of organizations (Suicide Prevention Foundation of America, American Society of Suicide, Jed Foundation; [ 5]), and curriculum are also available to teach practitioners and prepare them for the experience of losing a patient. suicide (6).

Voluntary euthanasia is legal in the Netherlands, Belgium, Columbia, and Luxembourg. Assisted suicide is legal in Switzerland, Germany, and Canada. Physician-assisted suicide (or assisted suicide) involves the introduction of patient-death procedures to be used at a time of patient choice. In voluntary euthanasia, the physician plays an active role in fulfilling the patient's request; that usually involves intravenous administration of a lethal substance.).

Variations in substance risk perceptions are influenced by many factors, including medical findings and psychiatric sequelae from substance use and social consequences.

However, the concept of addictive personality, which has been described so differently by some behavioral scientists, has little scientific evidence to back it up. Certain circumstances and coexisting disorders appear to increase the risk. For example, people who are sad, emotionally distressed, or socially alienated may find these feelings temporarily alleviated by a substance; this can lead to increased use and sometimes a substance use disorder. Patients with other disorders unrelated to psychosis are at increased risk of developing a substance use disorder. Patients with chronic pain (eg, back pain, sickle cell disease, neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia) often take opioids for pain relief; Many people then develop a use disorder. However, in many of these patients, non-opioid medications and other treatments do not completely relieve physical and emotional pain. Addiction can be a polygenic disorder. There are several genetic and epigenetic factors that influence the progression of addiction. Research regarding specific genetic abnormalities varies by specific stimulant. Pearls & Pitfalls The concept of addictive personality has very little scientific evidence to back it up. Context Cultural and social factors are important in initiating and sustaining (or reusing) substance use. Observing family members (parents, siblings) and peers using substances increases the risk that people will start using substances. Peers have a particularly strong influence on adolescents (see Drug and substance abuse among adolescents). People who are trying to stop using a substance find it much more difficult if they are around other people who also use the substance. Physicians may unwittingly contribute to the harmful use of psychoactive drugs by overprescribing these drugs for stress relief. Many social factors, including the mass media, contribute to patients' expectations that medication should be used to alleviate all depression.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, defects in or injury to certain areas of the brain have also been linked to some mental conditions.
Genetics (heredity): Many mental illnesses run in families, suggesting that people who have a family member with a mental illness are more susceptible (have a greater likelihood of being affected) to developing a mental illness.

Although there are different types of psychotherapy, each relies on communications as the basic tool for bringing about change in a person's feelings and behaviors.
Psychotherapy may involve an individual child, a group of children, a family, or multiple families. In children and adolescents, playing, drawing, building, and pretending, as well as talking, are important ways of sharing feelings and resolving problems.
As part of the initial assessment, a qualified mental health professional or child and adolescent psychiatrist will determine the need for psychotherapy. This decision will be based on such things as the child's current problems, history, level of development, ability to cooperate with treatment, and what interventions are most likely to help with the presenting concerns. Psychotherapy is often used in combination with other treatments (medication, behavior management, or work with the school). The relationship that develops between the therapist and the client is very important. The child or adolescent must feel comfortable, safe and understood. This type of trusting environment makes it much easier for the child to express his/her thoughts and feelings and to use the therapy in a helpful way.
Psychotherapy helps children and adolescents in a variety of ways. They receive emotional support, resolve conflicts with people, understand feelings and problems, and try out new solutions to old problems.
